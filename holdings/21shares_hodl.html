Wir zeigen die wichtigsten Metriken f√ºr BNB unten (Abb. 1).\n\nDies ist insbesondere auf die Verwendung eines Token-Burn-Mechanismus zur√ºckzuf√ºhren - bei dem eine bestimmte Menge an BNB verbrannt und aus dem gesamten zirkulierenden Angebot des Krypto-Assets entfernt wird, bezogen auf die Anzahl der Token (in US-Dollar), die 20 Prozent der Einnahmen von Binance aus dem Handelsvolumen entspricht.\n\nObwohl der Wert von BNB, wie jeder finanzielle Verm√∂genswert, zu jedem Zeitpunkt bis zu einem gewissen Grad von Spekulationen und √Ñnderungen der breiteren Krypto-Marktbedingungen abh√§ngt, ist dieser Krypto-Verm√∂genswert zudem eng mit bedeutenden Entwicklungen bei Binance und der Produktpalette des Unternehmens verbunden ‚Äì wie beispielsweise sein fr√ºher Aufstieg w√§hrend der Initial-Coin-Offering-Blase, der Start von Binance Chain, seine Token-Verbrennungen, und die zunehmenden b√∂rsenunabh√§ngigen Anwendungsf√§lle von BNB. \n\nIm Allgemeinen ist Binance gut positioniert, um seine Strategie der Expansion in Bereiche wie Futures, Margenhandel, Kreditvergabe, Fiat-Krypto-On-Ramps und Stablecoin-bezogene Initiativen fortzusetzen. Wir glauben, dass Binance gut ger√ºstet ist, um letztendlich in einer Reihe dieser Vertikalen erfolgreich zu sein. Der wichtigste Werttreiber von BNB ist der Erfolg von Binance. Deshalb ist das Krypto-Asset gut aufgestellt, um von der anhaltenden Dominanz von Binance zu profitieren.\n\nEs sollte jedoch beachtet werden, dass Binance und BNB auch eine Reihe von sp√ºrbaren Risiken schultern, von denen jedes einzelne den Erfolg wechselseitig negativ beeinflussen k√∂nnte. Am auff√§lligsten ist die Anf√§lligkeit von Binance und BNB f√ºr gewisse regulatorische Risiken. Das liegt an der Binance selbst, mit ihrer breiten Palette von Notierungen, und dar√ºber hinaus auch am regulatorischen Status von BNB in den Vereinigten Staaten sowie an den sogenannten ‚ÄûRoadblocks‚Äú, das sind sprichw√∂rtliche Verkehrsblockaden, mit denen B√∂rse und W√§hrung an den Durchg√§ngen zwischen Fiat und Krypto konfrontiert sein k√∂nnte."}},en:{intro:{slogan:"BNB is the native cryptocurrency of the world‚Äôs largest crypto exchange."},about:{title:"Binance is the world‚Äôs leading cryptocurrency exchange and consistently facilitates 10s of billions of dollars‚Äô worth of cryptocurrency trading.

We show the key metrics for BNB below (Fig. 1).\n\nNotably due to the use of a token burn mechanism ‚Äî wherein a certain amount of BNB is burned and removed from the crypto asset‚Äôs total circulating supply, based on the number of tokens (in USD dollars) equivalent to 20% of Binance‚Äôs proceeds raised from its trading volume.\n\nWhilst, like any financial asset, BNB‚Äôs value at any point is driven to an extent by speculation and changes in wider crypto-market conditions, the crypto asset is also closely tied to significant developments in Binance and the company‚Äôs range of products ‚Äî such as Binance‚Äôs early rise to prominence during the initial coin offering bubble, the launch of Binance Chain, its token burns, and the increasing non-exchange-related use cases for BNB. In general, Binance is well positioned to continue its strategy of expanding into avenues such as futures, margin trading, lending, fiat-crypto on-ramps, and stablecoin-related initiatives. We believe that Binance is well placed to eventually succeed in a number of these verticals. Given BNB‚Äôs key value driver is the success of Binance, the crypto asset is also well placed to benefit from Binance‚Äôs continued dominance.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that Binance and BNB also shoulder a number of noticeable risks, any one of which could negatively affect the success of both.

Inoltre √® un mezzo per gli investitori per ottenere sconti e promozioni varie sui prodotti di Binance.

Significa che un certo quantitativo di BNB viene cancellato e rimosso dall‚Äôofferta di criptovaluta circolante complessiva. Questa quota varia in base al numero di asset in circolazione (espresso in dollari) ed equivale al 20% dei proventi che Binance accumula dagli scambi.\n\nSebbene il valore del BNB in un determinato momento abbia una certa componente speculativa ‚Äì come ogni asset finanziario, del resto ‚Äì √® anche strettamente connesso agli sviluppi nella piattaforma e alla gamma di prodotti che questa offre.

In generale, Binance √® ben posizionata per proseguire nella sua strategia di espansione verso altri settori, come quello dei futures, dello scambio di margin, dei prestiti, delle monete fiat in via di sviluppo e delle iniziative connesse alle stablecoin; e riteniamo che potr√† avere successo in una buona parte di questi. Dato che il fattore pi√π importante per il BNB √® successo di Binance, anche questa criptovaluta √® in un‚Äôottima posizione per registrare grandi performance, sfruttandone la dominanza.\n\nTuttavia, √® bene specificare che a Binance e al suo BNB √® legato anche un buon numero di rischi, ognuno dei quali pu√≤ compromettere il successo di entrambi.

Transaktionsdatenbanken. Vereinfacht ausgedr√ºckt setzt das System zudem Anreize, dass sich Betrug nicht lohnt beziehungsweise, dass man bei korrektem Verhalten Geld, also Bitcoins, verdient.\n\n\n\nUm das Sch√∂pfen von Bitcoins (Mining) zu verstehen, muss man wissen, wie die Blockchain funktioniert und wie die Krypto-Buchhalter oder Mineure (Miner) neue Transaktionen in das Ledger bzw. die Transaktionsdatenbank aufnehmen.\n\n\n\nDazu ein Beispiel: In einer einfachen Bitcoin-Transaktion sendet Adam an Sarah einen Bitcoin. Adam hat dann einen Bitcoin weniger und Sarah einen mehr. Sobald Adam die √úbermittlung beginnt, wird die Transaktion √ºber das Netzwerk versendet aber noch nicht validiert. Die Miner sammeln die nicht validierten Transaktionen und fassen diese in einem Block zusammen. Sie pr√ºfen dann, ob Adam das entsprechende Guthaben besitzt und an Sarah senden kann. Dabei darf der Miner, der ein sehr komplexes mathematisches Problem l√∂sen kann, die Transaktion validieren und diese im Netzwerk ver√∂ffentlichen.\n\n\n\nDanach best√§tigen andere Miner, dass die L√∂sung richtig ist und √ºberpr√ºfen, ob der Absender √ºber das entsprechende Guthaben verf√ºgt. Das best√§tigt die Transaktionen im Block und der gesamte Block wird dem Ledger hinzugef√ºgt, w√§hrend die Miner zum n√§chsten Block √ºbergehen. Daher der Name Blockchain.\n\n\n\nDie Miner m√ºssen √ºber umfangreiche Computerkapazit√§ten zur L√∂sung des mathematischen Problems verf√ºgen (was viel Strom verbraucht und mit entsprechenden Kosten verbunden ist), bevor sie die L√∂sung im Netzwerk ver√∂ffentlichen k√∂nnen. Daher erh√§lt der erste Miner, der das R√§tsel l√∂st, eine Belohnung ‚Äì und zwar 12,5 neu gesch√ºrfte Bitcoins.\n\n\n\nDie enormen erforderlichen Computerkapazit√§ten halten die Miner davon ab, zu betr√ºgen oder Daten zu f√§lschen.

This solves the famous Byzantine Generals Problem, specifically what happens if a traitor General sends two conflicting messages ‚Äì one to ‚Äúattack‚Äù and another to ‚Äúretreat‚Äù ‚Äì to two different parties.\n\nIn order to accomplish this, the Blockchain ‚Äì this public ledger of all transactions ‚Äì has to be synced accurately. The way we accomplish that, to put it very simply, is by making it prohibitively expensive to cheat. It doesn‚Äôt pay to cheat. In fact, the system will financially reward you (you‚Äôll make money!) That‚Äôs where bitcoin comes in.\n\nFor that, we have to talk about the mechanics of the Blockchain, specifically how new transactions are added to the ledger, in a process called ‚Äúmining.‚Äù But to keep things simple let‚Äôs just think of these ‚Äúminers‚Äù as book keepers.\n\nThe following is an oversimplification but should explain at a basic level how the Blockchain syncs all these transactions. In a simple bitcoin transaction, Adam sends Sarah 1 bitcoin, which should decrease the number of bitcoins in his wallet by 1 and increase the number of bitcoins by 1. As soon as he starts the transfer, the transaction will be broadcast across the network but not be validated yet.\n\nWhat the book keepers (or ‚Äúminers‚Äù) do is collect a bunch of un-validated transactions and group them into a ‚Äúblock‚Äù. They then check whether the sender of the funds has the correct amount and is able to send this transaction to the receiver. The miner that is able to announce this to the network Is the first to solve a really long math puzzle; only after finding the solution are they allowed to post this to the network. After that, other miners confirm that the solution is correct and double-check that the sender has enough money. That confirms the transactions in the block and the entire block is added to the ledger while miners move on to the next block, hence the name Blockchain.\n\nIn order to incentivize these miners, who have to use a lot of computer power (which uses a lot of electricity, which costs a lot of money) to solve the mathematical problem before announcing the solution to the network, the first miner who solves it gets rewarded. They specifically make 12.5 bitcoin, which are created from scratch and added to their wallet.\n\nBecause of the large amount of computing power required, miners are de-incentivized from cheating or forging records. Quite the opposite happens. They are incentivized ‚Äì by being rewarded financially ‚Äì to keep the system true and synced. The network needed a native currency to pay these miners with. That currency is bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin is simply the network‚Äôs currency used to pay miners who sync and validate the network."}},it:{intro:{slogan:"Il Bitcoin √® **l‚ÄôOro Digitale**"},about:{title:"Il Bitcoin √® sicuramente il pi√π grande e popolare cripto-bene.",body:"Parlando della Blockchain, abbiamo detto che la sua funzione primaria √® quella di permettere a un gruppo di persone che possono conoscersi (e fidarsi l‚Äôuno dell‚Äôaltro) o meno, per raggiungere un consenso distribuito su quale sia la verit√†.

Per far s√¨ che questo sia possibile, molto semplicemente, la si rende estremamente costosa da imbrogliare. Chi imbroglia, non guadagna nulla. Al contrario, il sistema prevede delle ricompense (si guadagna del denaro!). Ed √® qui che entra in gioco il bitcoin.\n\n\n\nA questo proposito, dobbiamo parlare della meccanica del Blockchain, nello specifico di come le transazioni nuove vengono aggiunte al ledger, tramite un processo chiamato ‚Äúmining‚Äù. Per semplificare, pensiamo ai minatori come dei contabili.\n\n\n\nQuesta √® una semplificazione estrema ma dovrebbe servire a spiegare come la Blockchain sincronizza tutte le transazioni. In una semplice transazione bitcoin, Adam manda a Sarah 1 bitcoin. Questo dovrebbe far scendere di 1 il numero di bitcoin nel suo portafoglio e aumentare il numero di bitcoin di 1 nell protafoglio di Sarah. Non appena Adam inizia il trasferimento, la transazione viene trasmessa nella rete ma non ancora convalidata.\n\n\n\nIl ruolo dei contabili (i minatori) √® di raccogliere un numero di transazioni non ancora convalidate e raggrupparle in un ‚Äúblock‚Äù. In seguito, i minatori controllano se chi ha inviato i fondi ne possiede abbastanza e pu√≤ quindi inviare la sua transazione al ricevente. Il minatore che √® in grado di comunicarlo alla rete √® il primo a risolvere un quesito matematico molto lungo; soltanto dopo aver trovato la soluzione, pu√≤ condividerla con la rete. In seguito, altri minatori confermano che la soluzione sia corretta e verificano nuovamente che chi ha inviato i fondi ne abbia a sufficienza. In questo modo, la transazione √® confermata all‚Äôinterno del block e quest‚Äôultimo viene aggiunto al ledger, mentre i minatori passano al block successivo. Da qui il termine Blockchain (‚Äúcatena di blocchi‚Äù).\n\n\n\nI minatori devono usare un‚Äôelevata quantit√† di potenza di calcolo (il che comporta un alto consumo di elettricit√† e una grossa spesa di denaro). Perci√≤, per incentivarli a risolvere il problema matematico prima di annunciare la soluzione alla rete, il primo a farlo riceve una ricompensa. Nello specifico, riceve 12,5 bitcoin, creati da zero e aggiunti al proprio portafogli.\n\n\n\nA causa dell‚Äôenorme quantit√† di potenza di calcolo necessaria, i minatori sono scoraggiati a imbrogliare o contraffare i registri. Anzi, accade il contrario. Sono incentivati ‚Äì tramite le ricompense in denaro ‚Äì a mantenere il sistema sempre veritiero e sincronizzato.

Jedermann kann so unabh√§ngig von Dritten eine Transaktion zwischen zwei Parteien √ºberpr√ºfen. Die Bitcoin-Blockchain erledigt dies f√ºr Transaktionen von Bitcoins zwischen zwei Konten beziehungsweise Wallets mit Hilfe kryptographischer digitaler Signaturen. Was aber, wenn man die Blockchain nicht nur f√ºr Geldtransfers nutzen m√∂chte? Oder was, wenn man mehr Regeln und Bedingungen bei Geldtransfers einbauen m√∂chte? F√ºr diese Aufgaben wurde Ethereum entwickelt.\n\n\n\n**Smart Contracts**\n\n\n\nSmart Contracts sind Computerprotokolle, die eine Vertragsabwicklung technisch unterst√ºtzen. Die Anwendungen k√∂nnen so programmiert werden, dass unter bestimmten Bedingungen eine Transaktion automatisch eintritt. Sinnvoll sind Smart Contracts beispielsweise f√ºr die Abwicklung von Versicherungsvertr√§gen, bei der die Schadensabwicklung arbeitsintensiv ist.\n\n\n\nEin Beispiel sind Erdbeben-Basisversicherungen. Mit einem Smart Contract kann zum Beispiel programmiert werden, dass bei einem Erdbeben mit einer St√§rke von mehr als 6,5 auf der Richter-Skala sofort das Ethereum-Wallet der Versicherungsgesellschaft genutzt wird, um den Auszahlungsbetrag an Ihr pers√∂nliches Ethereum-Wallet zu senden.\n\n\n\nDa es sich um ein Computerprogramm handelt, k√∂nnte man nat√ºrlich auch noch differenzierter vorgehen. Beispielsweise k√∂nnte man das Programm wie folgt programmieren:\n\n\n\n* Wenn die St√§rke gr√∂sser als 6,5 auf der Richter-Skala ist und sich Ihr Haus innerhalb von 25 Kilometern vom Epizentrum befindet, erhalten Sie 100% der Versicherungssumme.\n* Wenn die St√§rke gr√∂sser als 6,5 auf der Richter-Skala ist und sich Ihr Haus innerhalb von 50 Kilometern vom Epizentrum befindet, erhalten Sie 40% der Versicherungssumme.\n* Wenn die St√§rke gr√∂sser als 6,5 auf der Richter-Skala ist und sich Ihr Haus innerhalb von 100 Kilometern vom Epizentrum befindet, erhalten Sie 10% der Versicherungssumme.\n\nAll dies kann v√∂llig dezentral und ohne Eingriffe Dritter abgewickelt werden. In diesem Beispiel w√ºrde die Versicherungsgesellschaft keine Mitarbeiter an Telefonen und Computern besch√§ftigen m√ºssen, um die Schadensmeldungen anzunehmen und abzuwickeln. Das heisst, sie w√ºrde Zeit und Geld sparen.\n\n\n\nGrunds√§tzlich kommen Smart Contracts f√ºr die unterschiedlichsten Anwendungsf√§lle oder Branchen infrage, die von einer schnelleren, fehlerfreien und dezentralen Smart-Contract-Plattform profitieren k√∂nnen:\n\n\n\n**Finanzen**\n\n\n\nHypotheken, Anleihen, der Zahlungsverkehr, Abrechnungen, Versicherungen und Grundst√ºcksregister sind Gesch√§ftsfelder, die heute Dritte und Verwalter erfordern, die durch Smart Contracts ersetzt werden k√∂nnten.\n\n\n\n_Beispiel: Eine Anleiheemission, die zur F√§lligkeit gelangt, zahlt sich automatisch in die Wallets der Anleihegl√§ubiger aus._\n\n\n\n**Finanzierung**\n\n\n\nDie gr√∂sste Anwendung von Smart Contracts gab es ab 2017 bei Unternehmen, die Tokens oder Aktien dezentral √ºber ein Initial Coin Offering (ICO) emittierten. Die Methode ist denkbar einfach: Wenn der K√§ufer Geld an ein bestimmtes Wallet mit einem Smart Contract schickt, werden ihm automatisch bestimmte Tokens bestimmter Typen oder Betr√§ge auszahlen.\n\n\n\n_Beispiel: ICOs von Unternehmen und Startups durch die Emission von Tokens._\n\n\n\n**Identit√§t**\n\n\n\nIdentit√§tsdiebstahl ist weit verbreitet. Diesem kann man mit einem vertrauensw√ºrdigen dezentralen Netzwerk entgegenwirken. Wenn beispielsweise ein Vermieter √ºberpr√ºfen muss, ob Sie derjenige sind, der Sie vorgeben zu sein und dass Sie genug Geld haben, um die Miete zu bezahlen, brauchen sie eigentlich keine Papierkopien Ihres Bankkontos und Reisepasses, die leicht gestohlen oder verloren werden k√∂nnen. Der Vermieter m√ºssen nur bestimmte Bedingungen in einer vertrauensw√ºrdigen Weise √ºberpr√ºfen.\n\n\n\n_Beispiel: Bei Apps, bei denen man sich mit Benutzernamen und Passw√∂rtern legitimieren muss, besteht die Gefahr, dass Zugangsdaten gehackt oder gestohlen werden. Mithilfe einer Blockchain kann man Identit√§ten sicher und unter Wahrung der Privatsph√§re √ºberpr√ºfen._\n\n\n\n**Politik und √∂ffentliche Verwaltung**\n\n\n\nDie Politik und √∂ffentliche Verwaltungen k√∂nnen die Blockchain nutzen, um effektiver zu regieren und zu regulieren. Verwaltungs-Funktionen k√∂nnen logisch in einen Smart Contract eingebettet werden, wodurch der Aufwand zum Beispiel die manuelle Pr√ºfung von Transaktionen eingeschr√§nkt werden kann.\n\n\n\n_Beispiel: Eigentumsbeurkundungen auf der Blockchain. Sobald jemand die Urkunde zu einem Grundst√ºck hat, ist es eine √∂ffentliche Information und wird auf der Blockchain ohne Manipulation oder Betrug angezeigt._"}},en:{intro:{slogan:"Ethereum is like a **global computer**"},about:{title:"Ethereum is a platform to build decentralized applications.",body:"One of the best things about the Blockchain is that it took out intermediaries and middlemen, allowing anyone to verify a transaction between two parties without requiring third parties. The Bitcoin Blockchain does this for transactions of bitcoin between two wallets using cryptographic digital signatures. But what if we wanted to use the Blockchain for other applications besides transferring money? Or what if we wanted to include more rules and logic with applications involving money? For these use cases, Ethereum was built.\n\n\n\n**Smart Contracts**\n\nA smart contract can be thought of more easily as a digital self-executing contract. Applications can be programmed such that if certain conditions are met, a certain end result will happen.\n\nIt is most useful in cases where human intervention is required today, resulting in a significant amount of time for claims.\n\nThink about a basic insurance policy after a hurricane or earthquake. With a smart contract, we could program rules that specify, for example, that if an earthquake occurs with a magnitude higher than 6.5 on the Richter scale, the insurance company‚Äôs Ethereum wallet will immediately be used to send to your personal Ethereum wallet your insurance payout amount.\n\nGiven that it‚Äôs a computer program, we can of course be even more specific. We could very easily program such a program so that,\n\n* If the magnitude is higher than 6.5 on the Richter scale and your house is within 25 miles of the epicenter, you get paid 100% of insurance payout amount.\n* If the magnitude is higher than 6.5 on the Richter scale and your house is within 50 miles of the epicenter, you get paid 40% of insurance payout amount.\n* If the magnitude is higher than 6.5 on the Richter scale and your house is within 100 miles of the epicenter, you get paid 10% of insurance payout amount.\n\nAll of this can be executed in a completely decentralized way without any third parties or human interaction. This example would save the insurance company from having to staff humans on phones and computers to take these claims and they would save you time and money.\n\nOne can easily see an endless number of other alternative use cases or industries that would benefit from a faster, flawless, decentralized smart contract platform, including:\n\n\n\n**Finance**\n\nMortgages, bonds, payments, settlements, insurance, and property records are all activities that require significant third parties and administrators today that could be replaced by smart contracts.\n\n_Example: a bond issuance that gets to maturity automatically disburses to bond holders‚Äô wallets._\n\n\n\n**Fundraising**\n\nWe saw the largest application of smart contracts starting in 2017 with companies selling tokens or equity in a decentralized and highly scalable way through initial coin offering (ICOs). The way it worked was very simple: if the buyer sent currency to a certain wallet powered by a smart contract, the contract would automatically disburse to him specific tokens in specific types or amounts.\n\n_Example: the ICOs used by companies and startups to raise money by issuing tokens_\n\n\n\n**Identity**\n\nIdentity theft is prevalent and a great use case for a trusted decentralized network. When a landlord needs to verify that you are who you say you are and that you have enough money to pay rent, they don‚Äôt actually need to get paper copies of your bank account and passport that can easily be stolen or lost. They just need to verify a certain set of conditions in a trusted manner. This is a perfect application for a smart contract.\n\n_Example: Mobile apps can remove the need for usernames\u002Fpasswords that can be hacked or stolen, verifying your identity on the Blockchain in a private and safe way._\n\n\n\n**Government**\n\nGovernment can use a Blockchain to govern and regulate more effectively. Imagine audit functions that can be embedded logically in a smart contract, taking the need for third party human auditors spending a significant amount of time auditing transactions manually.\n\n_Example: Title or property registration on the Blockchain. Once someone has the deed to a land, it‚Äôs public information and displayed on the Blockchain without tampering or fraud abilities._"}},it:{intro:{slogan:"Ethereum √® **un Computer Globale**"},about:{title:"Ethereum √® una piattaforma finalizzata alla creazione di applicazioni decentralizzate.",body:"Uno dei benefici derivati dalla Blockchain √® l‚Äôaver eliminato intermediari e mediatori, permettendo a chiunque di verificare una transazione tra due parti senza il bisogno di terzi.

A tal fine, √® stato creato Ethereum.\n\n\n\n**Smart Contract**\n\n\n\nUn contratto interlligente, o ‚ÄúSmart Contract‚Äù, pu√≤ essere pi√π facilmente immaginato come un contratto auto-esecutivo. √à possibile programmare applicazioni in modo tale che, se vengono rispettate determinate condizioni, si otterr√† un determinato risultato finale.\n\n\n\n√à utile soprattutto in casi dove oggi si richiede l‚Äôintervento umano, il che porta a un discreto spreco di tempo per le richieste.\n\n\n\nPensate a una semplice polizza assicurativa dopo un uragano o un terremoto.

Funziona in maniera molto semplice: se l‚Äôacquirente invia valuta a un determinato portafogli alimentato da smart contract, il contratto gli erogher√† automaticamente dei token di uno specifico valore o tipo.\n\n\n\n_Esempio: le ICO usate dalle societ√† e dalle startup per raccogliere denaro emettendo token_\n\n__\n\n**Identit√†**\n\n\n\nIl furto di identit√† √® un ottimo esempio d‚Äôuso per una rete decentralizzata sicura. Quando il proprietario di casa ha bisogno di verificare che voi siate chi dite di essere e che abbiate abbastanza denaro per pagare l‚Äôaffitto, non avr√† pi√π bisogno delle copie cartacee dei vostri estratti conto o passaporti, che possono essere facilmente rubati o andare perduti. Avr√† semplicemente bisogno di verificare determinate condizioni in maniera sicura. Il caso perfetto per usare un smart contract.\n\n\n\n_Esempio: nelle app per cellulari √® possibile eliminare la necessit√† di nome utente\u002Fpassword, dati che possono essere facilmente trafugati, verificando la vostra identit√† sulla Blockchain in modalit√† privata e del tutto sicura._\n\n\n\n**Governo**\n\n\n\nIl governo potrebbe servirsi della Blockchain per agire in maniera pi√π efficace. Pensate alle funzioni di revisione, che possono essere integrate in maniera logica a un smart contract, eliminando la necessit√† di revisori umani terzi che impiegano tempo a revisionare manualmente le transazioni.\n\n\n\n_Esempio: registrazione di titoli o beni immobili sulla Blockchain.

Im Wesentlichen fungiert das Ripple-Netzwerk als B√∂rse f√ºr Banken und Zahlungsdienstleister. Diese nutzen das gleiche Zahlungsprotokoll auf Basis eines verteilten Open-Source-Internetprotokolls, eines Konsens-Ledgers und der dezentralen Krypto-W√§hrung XRP.\n\n\n\nXRP ist ein Token, um die Wert√ºbertragung √ºber das Ripple-Netzwerk darzustellen. Zum Beispiel k√∂nnen 100 US-Dollar auf Johns Konto sofort in entsprechende XRP-Token umgewandelt, √ºber das Ripple-Netzwerk auf Pierres Konto √ºbertragen und dann in eine andere Papierw√§hrung oder ein anderes Krypto-Guthaben umgewandelt werden.

Das heisst, dass die gesamten Einheiten der W√§hrung bereits zu Beginn des Netzwerks mit einer Gesamtsumme von 100 Milliarden geschaffen wurden. Es werden also keine Miner ben√∂tigt und es m√ºssen keine Anreize geschaffen werden, um die Transaktionen zu validieren.

For example:\n\n\n\n* What if one bank enters the wrong account number?\n* What if one party in the transaction defaults or reneges on the agreed transaction?\n* What if there is no bank at the destination country to receive the transfer?\n\n\n\nTo improve the system and address these drawbacks, banks and payment companies across the world need a shared protocol to provide real-time data, reliable tracking and cost efficiency.\n\n\n\nRipple Labs, founded in 2012, enables real-time global transfer of money across a network of 100+ banks and payment providers. In essence, Ripple‚Äôs network functions as an exchange for banks and payment providers to operate under the same payment protocol, powered by a distributed open-source internet protocol, consensus ledger and the decentralized native cryptocurrency known as XRP.\n\n\n\nXRP is a token used for representing transfer of value across the Ripple Network. For example, $100 in John‚Äôs account can be converted instantly into equivalent XRP tokens, which can be instantly transferred to Pierre‚Äôs account over the Ripple network, who could then convert it into another fiat currency or crypto asset. This process would typically take seconds or minutes instead of days when using a wire transfer.\n\n\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, XRP is pre-mined meaning that every single unit of the currency that will ever exist has already been created at the beginning of the network with a grand total of 100 billion. Thus, no miners are needed or need to be incentivised to validate each transaction. Instead, a network of servers is established and developed to validate transactions across Ripple Network based on a consensus protocol."}},it:{intro:{slogan:"Ripple √® un nuovo modo di **trasferire denaro**"},about:{title:"Ripple: applicazione nel mondo reale del concetto di Blockchain",body:"Uno dei campi in cui la Blockchain pu√≤ affermarsi prepotentemente √® il trasferimento di denaro.\n\n\n\nI trasferimenti di denaro, a lungo dominati dai sistemi bancari tradizionali e dai gestori di pagamento, sono diventati procedimenti lunghi e difficili per via di tempi e costi.\n\n\n\nAltri problemi relativi al modello tradizionale di trasferimento di denaro possono dilungare e complicare ulteriormente il procedimento, aumentandone anche i costi. Ad esempio:\n\n\n\n* Se una delle banche inserisce il numero di conto sbagliato?\n* Se una delle parti nella transazione √® inadempiente o si tira indietro dalla transazione accordata?\n* Se non c‚Äô√® nessuna banca nel paese di destinazione a ricevere il trasferimento?\n\nPer migliorare il sistema e ovviare a questi inconvenienti, le banche e le societ√† di pagamento nel mondo necessitano di un protocollo condiviso per fornire dati in tempo reale, tracciabilit√† affidabile e costi vantaggiosi.\n\n\n\nRipple Labs, fondata nel 2012, permette il trasferimento in tempo reale di denaro in tutto il mondo attraverso una rete di pi√π di 100 banche e gestori di pagamento. In sostanza, la rete Ripple funziona come rete di scambio affinch√© banche e gestori di pagamento agiscano sotto lo stesso protocollo di pagamento, alimentato da un protocollo distribuito di libero accesso, un ledger di consenso e un cripto-bene nativa decentralizzata conosciuta come XRP.\n\n\n\nXRP √® un token usato per rappresentare un trasferimento di valuta all‚Äôinterno della Ripple Network. Ad esempio, 100 dollari nel conto di John possono essere convertiti all‚Äôistante in token XRP equivalenti, che a loro volta possono essere trasferiti all‚Äôistante sul conto di Pierre nella Ripple Network, che pu√≤ poi convertirli in un‚Äôaltra moneta legale o cripto-bene. Per questo processo di solito occorre qualche secondo o minuto, rispetto ai giorni necessari per effettuare un bonifico.\n\n\n\nA differenza del Bitcoin, la XRP √® pre-mined, vale a dire che ogni singola unit√† della valuta che esister√† √® stata gi√† creata all‚Äôinizio della rete per un totale di 100 miliardi. Di conseguenza, non sono necessari i miners n√© √® necessario incentivarli a convalidare ogni transazione.

Der Token von Binance, BNB, wurde von 21Shares am 15. Oktober 2019 in Europa in den 21Shares BNB ETP (ABNB) gepackt. ABNB ist an der SIX Swiss Exchange und der BX Swiss gelistet.

With a direct listing, the company will not issue new shares with an underwriter involved but will sell existing and outstanding shares on a public exchange.

ABNB is listed in the SIX Swiss Exchange and BX Swiss with over $214 million in assets under management as of February 19.\n\nBinance is the leading crypto exchange in spot volumes as you can see in the table below.

As part of 21Shares‚Äôs mission to make crypto assets as easy to invest in as stocks, we need to find a common language to describe the various ways to interpret relevant data and actions. In our experience, the terms ‚Äúforks‚Äù and ‚Äúairdrops‚Äù in particular, lead to questions and uncertainty from investors regarding their impact on the value of a given asset and how best to think of them conceptually. This article deals firstly with forks then finishes with a brief explanation of airdrops.\n\n# Forks\n\n**Forks** are the essential corporate governance action within the crypto asset world and they can be thought of in a couple of different ways depending on the specifics of the situation. The following categories are not necessarily mutually exclusive but offer an almost exhaustive categorization of the different sorts of forks possible:\n\n**A Soft Fork** is a system upgrade wherein newly created blocks made under the updated rules of the soft fork are still accepted by nodes running the older version of the software ‚Äì therefore maintaining their forwards-compatibility. As such, the set of possible valid blocks under a new soft fork ruleset is a proper subset of the group of possible valid blocks on the pre-forked chain. An example is the [SegWit fork](https:\u002F\u002Fen.bitcoin.it\u002Fwiki\u002FSegregated_Witness) on the Bitcoin network.\n\n**A Hard Fork** is similarly a system upgrade but, in this case, the newly created blocks made under the updated rules of the hard fork are not accepted by nodes running the older version of the software ‚Äì therefore rendering pre-fork clients no-longer forwards-compatible\u003Csup\u003E1\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E. An example of a Hard Fork is the [Constantinople fork](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.coindesk.com\u002Ftake-two-ethereum-is-getting-ready-for-the-constantinople-hard-fork-redo) on the Ethereum Network.\n\n**A Contested Fork**\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E is a fork that is not universally accepted by all network participants. If the upgrade isn‚Äôt accepted by all of the participants, this can result in a new chain being created, as was the case with the creation of Ethereum Classic following the DAO hard fork. Much like a stock split, these actions result in the creation of a new asset. This new asset is generally distributed to the holders\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E of the original asset and may be very different from the original product. This operational process is virtually identical to a stock split (including an ex-date announced in advance and a process for claiming those assets on behalf of holders). However, there are a couple of key differences between a contested fork and a stock split: a hard fork does not change the value of the legacy asset-based off historical evidence and you would not expect to see the corresponding drop in the per unit value of the parent asset that you see in the case of a stock split.\n\nThe below charts help illustrate this point by comparing Walmart (WMT) historical 2-for-1 stock splits to the Bitcoin-Bitcoin Cash hard fork respectively. The vertical lines represent the days of the Walmart stock splits in the first chart & the single vertical represents the Bitcoin Cash hard fork date in the second chart:\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\"100%\" height=\"350\" src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Fforks1-2.html\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\"100%\" height=\"350\" src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Fforks2.html\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\nThe second chart helps demonstrate how a  hard fork does not intrinsically transfer any value away from the legacy blockchain ‚Äì despite the high profile Bitcoin Cash fork, little value was diverted from Bitcoin.  The parent asset still has all the same intrinsic properties (number of nodes, speed of transaction, number of users etc.) and is generally viewed by the market as unchanged by this event. The newly created asset is just a copy of the client code of the parent network (usually with a few edits) that runs on a parallel network. Any potential value which could be transferred away would be a function of the network effects diverted due to users choosing to switch to the new blockchain. In fact, Bitcoin has forked (including chain & software forks) over 70 times yet none of the forks have had measurable effects on the value of BTC. However, even if these fork assets do not affect the value of the legacy asset, they can have significant value in their own right ‚Äì as is the case for Bitcoin Cash (and then Bitcoin Cash SV & ABC). In the case of stock splits the case is slightly more interesting, as the price-per-share following a 2-to-1 stock split would halve in theory; this fact, however, is not accurately shown in the data as most historical data providers adjust stock prices for stock splits.\n\n**An Uncontested Fork**, such as Ethereum‚Äôs recent Constantinople Fork, is a client upgrade that all of the participants (predominantly miners) in the network agree with. This is similar to a planned change of a member of the management team at a company ‚Äì for example, the CEO of Goldman announcing retirement with a planned, capable successor ‚Äì where the market reaction is likely to be neutral. While investors may have opinions on this shift affecting the valuation of the stock (or crypto asset), this isn‚Äôt typically a disruptive event. Similarly, in the blockchain world, an uncontested fork can often be a very positive development that improves some feature of the given network.\n\n**A Chain Split** relates to cases, similar to Contested Forks, where mutually incompatible chains come into existence for various reasons. For example, they can be the result of Hard Forks, Sybil attacks, or two miners discovering new blocks at similar times. However, a chain split is often not the result of deliberate action but instead due to bugs in client code which cause different versions of a given client (or differing clients of a given single chain) to have conflicting states, such as was the case with [BIP-50](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fbitcoin\u002Fbips\u002Fblob\u002Fmaster\u002Fbip-0050.mediawiki).\n\n# Disambiguation between chain fork and software fork\n\n One important point to mention is the distinction between a chain fork and a software fork. A chain fork can be defined as when a given blockchain splits into two unique chains either intentionally (as with the BCH fork) or unintentionally (due to a bug). A software fork is when a developer forks the Git repository where the code for the given blockchain client is hosted and creates a new crypto asset and blockchain that way.\n\n# Governance\n\n Governance is just as important within the crypto asset world as it is in the corporate world. For example, if forks are like corporate actions and can have a range of impacts on a given crypto asset, who are the key stakeholders who make the difference between the fork being contested or uncontested? Analogous to corporate governance where the various shareholders have the ultimate say in matters related to governance, in the case of crypto assets it is those who have a stake in the network ‚Äì whether this is the person or company that owns the tokens (for systems with on-chain governance\u003Csup\u003E4\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E like [MakerDAO](https:\u002F\u002Fmakerdao.com\u002F) or [Tezos](https:\u002F\u002Ftezos.com\u002F)) or the wide range of other mission-critical actors like developers, miners, & community members (for systems with off-chain governance\u003Csup\u003E5\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E like Bitcoin).\n\nIn the case of on-chain governance, similar to shareholders, the larger the token holdings a given address has, the more voting power one has. Over the last few years, several crypto assets have developed complex governance processes which share many similarities to the typical corporate governance process. For example, consider MakerDAO ‚Äì a project which has launched a stablecoin backed by a decentralized credit facility. Similar to AGMs, MakerDAO hosts [two weekly calls](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fmakerdao\u002Fcommunity\u002Ftree\u002Fmaster\u002Fgovernance\u002Ftranscripts) where stakeholders can discuss risk and governance topics. Moreover, like a shareholder voting process, token holders can [vote](https:\u002F\u002Fvote.makerdao.com\u002F) on particular issues.\n\nThe below chart shows the breakdown of votes (measured in MKR ‚Äì a Crypto Asset) for a governance initiative for MakerDAO:\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Fforks3-1.html\" width=\"100%\" height=\"350\" frameBorder=\"0\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\nOn the other hand, governance in off-chain governance is often much more nuanced than traditional corporate governance. It can be argued, for example, that miners are the most important stakeholder, as they are ultimately the ones who maintain the economic security and integrity of a given crypto asset network‚Äôs ledger. As a result, miner sentiment is often an especially important metric used when developers are considering whether to initiate a fork or not.  Voting power and control over systems upgrades are some of the more practical reasons why there is such heated debate about ostensibly more centralized networks such as XRP and more decentralized networks such as Bitcoin. While there are a number of ideological reasons for people in the crypto asset space preferring one set up over another, from a practical perspective, the more centralized a network is, the more concentrated the voting power will be in the case of key governance events and the more vulnerable the network of failure. It is similar to having a large activist shareholder in a standard corporate security situation. If you agree with their policies, there is no problem but if you disagree, they nevertheless have a significant amount of power to influence the evolution of the company and its commercial policies ‚Äì even in ways diametrically opposed to your own interests. Moreover, there remains the possibility that a bad actor could sway the opinion of that activist leading them to appoint someone unsuitable to the board or attempt an ill-advised acquisition resulting in significant loss of value for other shareholders.\n\n# Airdrops\n\n**Airdrops** are another important (corporate) governance action within the crypto asset world and they can also be thought of in a couple of different ways depending on the specifics of the situation. For example, Airdrops can be seen as the dividends of the blockchain space. They are essentially free assets given to incentivize certain types of behaviors on a network (e.g. signing up for a wallet, performing tasks to maintain the network, etc.). Generally, the recipient does not control when or how these are received once the action is completed. Furthermore, this type of action usually only occurs on much smaller networks looking to grow their user base. Unlike dividends, however, you would not necessarily expect to see the same decrease in value at the ex-date.\n\nAnother analogy for airdrops would be the bonus miles you are awarded for signing up for a new credit card or bank account. The company wants to incentivize you to do a certain thing (such as opening a wallet or a credit line) and is willing to provide a crypto asset with some monetary value to incentivize that behavior whether it be free crypto assets or credit card points.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe aim of this article has been to serve as a bridge between terminology in the crypto asset world and that of the corporate world. As has been shown, there is a great deal of overlap between the mechanisms for governance across the two and this will continue to be the case as engineers of crypto assets continue to experiment with how best to affect stakeholder politics.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThe information provided does not constitute a prospectus or other offering material and does not contain or constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of any offer to buy securities in any jurisdiction.\n\nSome of the information published herein may contain forward-looking statements.

Of these three costs, the spread is the only one that can be easily standardized amongst exchanges.

However, our spreads were calculated based on 24 hours worth of data which may not be an accurate representation of the data over longer time periods.\n\nWe would expect more reputable and popular crypto asset exchanges to have much tighter spreads and the data supports this hypothesis. The chart below plots spreads of the [Messari ‚ÄúReal 10‚Äù exchanges](https:\u002F\u002Fmessari.io\u002Farticle\u002Fintroducing-real-10-volume-and-liquid-market-cap-on-onchainfx) where the BTC\u002FUSD pair trades (excluding Bitfinex).\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Ftwo-1.html\" width=\"90%\" height=\"350\" frameBorder=\"0\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\nGemini and Coinbase Pro have noticeably lower spreads than the rest of the exchanges within the ‚ÄúReal 10‚Äù. However, Coinbase‚Äôs fiat-to-crypto retail service has much higher spreads presumably due to the spread fee of 0.5% that the company charges for all buy and sell transactions. Coinbase‚Äôs fiat-to-crypto retail service shares similarities with the service that a broker-dealer like TD Ameritrade would offer ‚Äì with the more simple user experience ostensibly justifying the much higher fees. During the sample time frame, the bid-ask spread for the Coinbase retail service was 1.03% ‚Äì much higher than most other exchanges and other products such as exchange-traded products.\n\nBelow we compare trading and deposit\u002Fwithdrawal fees among the same six exchanges.\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Ftwo-2.html\" width=\"90%\" height=\"350\" frameBorder=\"0\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\nCoinbase Pro generally leads with the lowest fees across the board ‚Äì being one of the few exchanges not to charge ‚ÄòMaker Fees‚Äô. Put simply, Maker Fees are paid when an investor adds liquidity to an exchange‚Äôs order book ‚Äì such as by placing a limit order below the market price when buying or above the market price when selling. Taker Fees are paid when an investor removes liquidity from the exchange‚Äôs order book by creating a trade order at the current market price.\n\n# Exchange-traded Products\n\nThe primary fee involved in crypto asset exchange-traded products is the expense ratio ‚Äì the fee charged by the investment company to manage the funds of investors; both currently trading Bitcoin exchange-traded products have the same annual expense ratio of 2.5%.  Exchange-traded products also have spreads which an investor must factor in. However, due to the ability of Authorized Participants (APs) to create and redeem shares of the ETP in situations of excess demand and supply, we would expect spreads over time to be much more stable than that on a crypto asset exchange.\n\nBelow we have plotted the spread over time for the 21Shares Bitcoin ETP.\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Fexchangecompar1.html\" width=\"90%\" height=\"300\" frameBorder=\"0\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\nThe spread for the ETP has been relatively stable and, due to the mechanics of the product, will likely to continue to do so.  Though, one must note that for any exchange-traded product one invests in through a broker-dealer there will be brokerage fees which must also be accounted for.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nAs more products which provide exposure to crypto assets are launched, it is important for investors to understand the relative trade-offs behind each kind. This research note has offered a brief insight into how great the variation in fees is between different crypto asset exchanges ‚Äì spreads, trading, and withdrawal\u002Fdeposit fees to be precise. For the most reputable professional trading exchanges, spreads are surprisingly small but get progressively larger among the less popular exchanges, and we the expect this to be the case for crypto assets less popular than Bitcoin as well.\n\nWhilst spreads were tight for professional exchanges such as Coinbase Pro, this was not the case for Coinbase‚Äôs retail service whose business model relies on them charging large commissions on spreads to more unsophisticated investors. On a side note, it is likely that spreads in ETPs will experience much less variance than that of crypto asset exchanges due to the role of Authorized Participants ‚Äì who will help spreads decrease as the products become more popular.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThe information provided does not constitute a prospectus or other offering material and does not contain or constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of any offer to buy securities in any jurisdiction.\n\nSome of the information published herein may contain forward-looking statements.

Some of the most interesting work that has been done analyzing these economies has been research around holding behaviour ‚Äì attempts to quantify the length of time over which agents hold onto a given crypto asset and how this changes. Some of the most promising work has been done on Bitcoin‚Äôs holding behaviour by [Unchained Capital](https:\u002F\u002Fblog.unchained-capital.com\u002Fbitcoin-data-science-pt-1-hodl-waves-7f3501d53f63), [Coin Metrics](https:\u002F\u002Fcoinmetrics.io\u002Frealized-capitalization\u002F), [Ikagi Capital](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.kanaandkatana.com\u002Fvaluation-depot-contents\u002F2019\u002F5\u002F30\u002Fexploration-of-bitcoin-days-destroyed), and [Adaptive Capital](https:\u002F\u002Fmedium.com\u002Fadaptivecapital\u002Fbitcoin-market-value-to-realized-value-mvrv-ratio-3ebc914dbaee). Our research builds on the current literature by using the UTXO Age Distribution, Realized Capitalization, and Coin Days Destroyed metrics for inter-crypto asset comparisons, as opposed to an intra-crypto asset comparison as has been the case in previous work. Doing this allows us to better understand the varying economic functions different crypto asset fulfil; for example, we can show that on-chain data supports the commonplace thesis that Bitcoin is a superior store of value to an inflationary crypto asset such as Dogecoin.\n\n**Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs)**\n\nIn order to properly understand the implications of the metrics, it is important to first explain how transactions work in an unspent transaction output (UTXO) crypto asset like Bitcoin. Each block in the Bitcoin blockchain consists of a series of transactions, each transaction spends the bitcoin previously received in another transaction earlier. Therefore, it is always the case that the input of one transaction is the output of a previous transaction. The [diagram](https:\u002F\u002Fbitcoin.org\u002Fen\u002Fblockchain-guide#introduction) below helps explain how this transaction model works.\n\n![diagram](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Fimageedit_15_2457319930.png \"diagram\")\n\nEach output of a given transaction can only be spent once, so all outputs can be classified as either unspent transaction output (UTXOs) or spent transaction outputs.\n\n# UTXO Age Distributions\n\nUnchained Capital‚Äôs work on UTXO age distribution builds on the [research](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.reddit.com\u002Fr\u002FBitcoin\u002Fcomments\u002F2n205b\u002Fan_area_chart_showing_the_distribution_of\u002F) done by [@jratcliff](https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002Fjratcliff) and is currently the best way to visualize the changes in holding behaviour of users of crypto assets. The metric builds on the fact that Bitcoin is a transaction-centric crypto asset [compared](https:\u002F\u002Fmedium.com\u002F@sunflora98\u002Futxo-vs-account-balance-model-5e6470f4e0cf) to an account-centric crypto asset like Ethereum. As such, each UTXO shares a timestamp with the transaction and block in which it was created. Moreover, all bitcoin in existence will always be contained in some UTXO ‚Äì allowing us to always assign an age to each existing bitcoin which measures when it was last used in a transaction. This metric simply looks backwards and analyses the age distribution of UTXOs over time ‚Äì grouping different UTXOs using age bands. Below we show the UTXO age distribution of Bitcoin as Unchained Capital did in their article:\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Ciframe src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Fhodl1.html\" width=\"100%\" height=\"520\" frameBorder=\"0\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cem\u003EData: Unchained Capital\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\nThere are several interesting things to note about this graph; firstly, the presence of distinct ‚ÄúHODL waves‚Äù throughout time. HODL waves are periods ‚Äúwhen a large amount of bitcoin transacts on the way up to and through a local price high, becoming recent BTC (1 day‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää1 week old), and then slowly ages into each later band as its new owners HODL‚Äù. There are several distinct HODL waves and we show two below: The Genesis HODL and The Great HODL.\n\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThe Genesis HODL (January 2009 ‚Äì June 2011)\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Ciframe src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Fhodl2-1.html\" width=\"100%\" height=\"520\" frameBorder=\"0\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cem\u003EData: Unchained Capital\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThe Great HODL (December 2013 ‚Äì December 2017)\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Ciframe src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Fhodl3.html\" width=\"100%\" height=\"520\" frameBorder=\"0\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cem\u003EData: Unchained Capital\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\nAn open question is whether this phenomenon is visible in other crypto assets and if so, in what way are cross-crypto asset HODL Waves similar and different. We will explore UTXO age-distribution graphs for other crypto assets in the coming weeks. \n\n# Realized Capitalization\n\nThe Realized Capitalization (or Realized Cap for short) was [formulated](https:\u002F\u002Fcoinmetrics.io\u002Frealized-capitalization\u002F) by the Coinmetrics team as a way to account for the large fractions of crypto assets which tend to get lost, but yet continue to be counted within the Market Capitalization calculation. Simply put, the metric can be seen as a historically-weighted UTXO market capitalization calculation for a given crypto asset. The metric becomes more meaningful as a measure to better understand the behaviour of crypto asset users when computed as a ratio against the crypto asset‚Äôs market capitalization. Below we plot the metric Market Value to Realized Value for the UTXO-based crypto assets from late 2016 onwards.\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Ciframe src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Fhodlupdate4.html\" width=\"100%\" height=\"620\" frameBorder=\"0\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cem\u003EData: Coin Metrics\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\nThe most notable thing we see by comparing Bitcoin to two other quite different crypto assets is that Bitcoin‚Äôs MVRV is generally higher than other‚Äì this is the case for all other UTXO-based crypto assets aside from Bitcoin Cash SV. The ratio can be used to understand the relationship between users of a given crypto asset with high time preferences and those with low time preferences. Bitcoin‚Äôs prominence as the most popular crypto asset and common base currency on many exchanges may help explain why its MVRV generally seems to be higher than other crypto assets.\n\n# Coin Days Destroyed\n\nThe Coin Days Destroyed metric introduced by [Ikagi Capital](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.kanaandkatana.com\u002Fvaluation-depot-contents\u002F2019\u002F5\u002F30\u002Fexploration-of-bitcoin-days-destroyed) relies on the concept of Bitcoin Days which are defined as: the quantity of bitcoin multiplied by the number of days since said bitcoin were moved. This allows us to segment circulating crypto assets into different groups based on the timeframes in which they were last moved. The Bitcoin Days Destroyed metric naturally follows from this as moving bitcoin which has been idle for some period of time, destroyed the number of days that it had accrued. The chart below plots the Bitcoin Days Destroyed metric over time.\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Ciframe src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Fhodlupdate5.html\" width=\"100%\" height=\"520\" frameBorder=\"0\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cem\u003ESource: Blockchair\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\nIn order to allow for comparisons of coin days destroyed across different crypto assets, we can use the Adjusted Coin Days Destroyed metric which is simply Coin Days Destroyed divided by the crypto asset‚Äôs circulating supply.\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Ciframe src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Fhodlupdate6-1.html\" width=\"100%\" height=\"520\" frameBorder=\"0\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003ESource: Blockchair\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\nThe metric can be understood as showing what proportion of old holdings of a given crypto asset are transferred or sold over time compared to the crypto asset‚Äôs circulating supply. Bitcoin generally had the lowest Adjusted Coin Days Destroyed value of the group of crypto assets suggesting that a smaller proportion of long-term holdings tended to be transferred for Bitcoin compared to other assets.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThis research report has demonstrated some of the analytic tools available for comparing the holding behaviours of different crypto assets. Both Realized Cap and Coin Days Destroyed are useful for inter-crypto asset comparisons, whilst the UTXO age distribution metric better visualizes how trends in holding behaviour changes over time for a given crypto asset. All the metrics seem to suggest the fact that users seem to have lower time preferences for holding bitcoin compared to other crypto assets ‚Äì a fact that was anecdotally accepted as true up until this point. We believe that more work will allow more refined comparisons of all aspects of economic behaviour on different crypto assets and this research is just the start.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThe information provided does not constitute a prospectus or other offering material and does not contain or constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of any offer to buy securities in any jurisdiction.\n\nSome of the information published herein may contain forward-looking statements.

Just in the last few months, the [news broke](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.bloomberg.com\u002Fnews\u002Farticles\u002F2018-10-05\u002Fyale-is-said-to-invest-in-crypto-fund-that-raised-400-million) of Harvard Management Company‚Äôs purchase of 95,833,333 Stacks Tokens (the native token of the Blockstack blockchain) alongside two other funds. Several months earlier we heard reports of the Yale Investment Office‚Äôs investments in Andreessen Horowitz‚Äôs crypto asset-focused fund and Paradigm ‚Äì the $400 million crypto fund founded by Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam and former Sequoia Capital partner Matt Huang. Moreover, there is [reason](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.thetradenewscrypto.com\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2019\u002F04\u002FThe-institutional-crypto-backers-How-endowments-are-allocating-to-cryptocurrency-investments.pdf) to believe that many other university endowment funds are beginning to test the waters with crypto asset investments, with [notable examples](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.theinformation.com\u002Farticles\u002Fharvard-stanford-mit-endowments-invest-in-crypto-funds) including the endowment funds of Stanford, MIT, and Dartmouth.\n\nA superficial argument would suggest that these inflows of institutional capital may represent the beginning of the next bull run within the industry, but we think there is much more to unpack. This article will assess the important role that university endowment funds play within capital markets and seek to explain what impact their entry into the crypto asset industry might have.\n\nPut simply, endowment funds are investment funds established by a foundation that makes consistent withdrawals from invested capital ‚Äì with the most significant example being that of university endowment funds. These types of funds are noteworthy due to their ties to some of the most prestigious and long-standing institutions within the United States, such as the Ivy League universities or the University of California system, as well as the vast amount of funds they have available to invest due to donations garnered over the years.\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Fendowment1.html\" width=\"90%\" height=\"350\" frameBorder=\"0\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\nIn 2009, not long after the recession, the value of the top 200 university endowment funds in the United States was just under $280 billion. The above chart plots the endowment fund sizes from 2008 to 2017. It shows that by 2013 the total value had increased to around ¬£370 billion. By 2017 it had reached $500 billion. Given the size of this sector, university endowment funds play an important role both as principal investors and as limited partners within other funds.\n\n# Endowment Funds as King Makers\n\nThis dual role of university endowment funds can best be exemplified within the crypto asset firm through the aforementioned investments made by the Yale Investment Office and Harvard Management Company. The Yale Investment Office and its Chief Investment Officer, David Swensen, have gained a reputation for delivering consistent market-beating returns whilst also actively seeking to invest in ‚Äò[unconventional assets](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.telegraph.co.uk\u002Finvesting\u002Ffunds\u002Finvest-like-yale-universitys-20bn-fund\u002F)‚Äô which have included Google and Amazon in the 1990s, and investments in Facebook, LinkedIn, and Airbnb more recently. Moreover, the Yale Investment Office could be argued to be playing a King Maker role in its venture capital investments which are [reported](https:\u002F\u002Fstatic1.squarespace.com\u002Fstatic\u002F55db7b87e4b0dca22fba2438\u002Ft\u002F5c8b09008165f55d4bec1a36\u002F1552615684090\u002F2018+Yale+Endowment.pdf) to have had an internal rate of return of 165.9% as of June 2018. Some of the notable venture capital funds which they are limited partners in, include Andreessen Horowitz, Benchmark, and Greylock Partners. The pie chart below shows the breakdown of both Harvard‚Äôs and Yale‚Äôs endowment fund investments by asset class. The chart helps demonstrate how the proportion of PE, VC, & alternative investments for these two endowment funds in particular is on the continued uprise (Harvard : Left, Yale : Right).\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Fendowment2-1.html\" width=\"100%\" height=\"550\" frameBorder=\"0\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\nThe story of Yale‚Äôs investment can, in fact, be attributed largely to their investments in venture capital (as well as real estate) where they have historically had an oversized allocation compared to the educational institutional mean. Moreover, much of Yale‚Äôs venture capital success is considered to be a result of the outsized success of certain software and internet companies within their venture capital investments‚Äô portfolios. Yale‚Äôs investments in Paradigm and A16z Crypto are signs of their expectation of similar opportunities within the crypto asset space. Most of the narrative around Yale‚Äôs endowment fund investments has focused on the impact of their unconventional investment style on their portfolio but nothing has been said about the impact of their investments on the venture capital firms they invest in ‚Äì in other words, their role as a kingmaker.\n\nAs much as the venture capital industry is one of product knowledge, technical proficiency, and grit, the success of a venture capitalist can also in part be attributed to their ability to network and signal to generate deal flow. A venture capitalist can signal in a variety of ways: having a good investment track record, through unique thought leadership or having previous success as an operator at a well-known company. Perhaps, an under-recognized but all-too-important alternative signal is a person‚Äôs ability to draw in prestigious limited partners. If so, **there is a no more prestigious limited partner than the endowment fund of an Ivy Plus\u003Csup\u003Ei\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E** institution. These institutions control a disproportionate amount of the total capital amongst educational institutions, as is shown below.\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Fendowment3.html\" width=\"90%\" height=\"350\" frameBorder=\"0\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\nBefore we switch focus to Harvard‚Äôs investment in Blockstack keep this one point in mind. Yale‚Äôs investments in A16z Crypto and Paradigm can be argued to have anointed them as kingmakers for the crypto asset industry. One shouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see future projects with the most promise, first go past the desks of Paradigm and A16z Crypto before they reach those of the more long-standing crypto asset funds. The implications of this, as well as the apparent dissonance between the nature of venture capital investing and that of crypto‚Äôs ostensible focus on the decentralization of finance, is important.\n\n# Vanishing hurdles for institutional capital\n\nHarvard Management Company‚Äôs (HMC) purchase of Stacks tokens represents the first noticeable, and therefore highly significant, example of an endowment fund directly investing in a crypto asset. This was likely made possible by the fact that Blockstack applied for a Regulation A+ exemption for their token without which the regulatory uncertainty may have prevented HMC from making the investment. This also signals the fact that such an approach ¬≠‚Äì using a Regulation A+ exemption ‚Äì may become more commonplace among projects looking to conduct token crowdsales which allow for institutional capital.\n\n# Squaring private investing and the decentralization of money\n\nThis article has used recent investments by the Harvard Management Company and the Yale Investment Office to illustrate the important role that university endowment funds play within capital markets. It has also shown that their entry into the crypto asset industry has positioned them as likely kingmakers for the industry. Certain parts of this analysis may seem at odds with the promise of decentralized finance (and alternative funding models) which partially acted as the impetus behind the 2017 token sale craze. Two dissonant themes stand out in particular: (1) the conflict between **open and free internet-based financial markets** and the **necessity for financial market regulation;** (2) the **paradoxical role of private early-stage investment in nascent internet protocols.**\n\nThe conflict present in (1) is that of a [Double Movement](https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FDouble_Movement) inherent in crypto asset regulation. Regulation allows the potential benefits of tokenization, such as lowered operational costs and the potential of funding open-source protocols, to be married with the consumer protections that securities law brings. The conflict in (2) is slightly more interesting. The first wave of private venture firms who invested in tokens benefitted from token pre-sale discounts with much shorter timeframes before the asset‚Äôs availability to public markets. Such opportunities are unlikely to exist going forward and, as the crypto asset funding market begins to morph into something more similar to traditional capital fundraising, many of the first vanguards of crypto asset funds may be crowded out by the better credentialed ‚ÄòKings‚Äô of A16z Crypto and Paradigm. In this case, many crypto asset funds face existential risk. In addition, the role that the retail investor will play in crypto asset capital markets is left uncertain given how much of the last retail wave of investing was driven by the unsubstantiated promise of venture capital-like returns.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThe information provided does not constitute a prospectus or other offering material and does not contain or constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of any offer to buy securities in any jurisdiction.\n\nSome of the information published herein may contain forward-looking statements.

On Wall Street, executive compensation is a constant [theme](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.forbes.com\u002Fsites\u002Fshelliekarabell\u002F2018\u002F02\u002F14\u002Fexecutive-compensation-is-out-of-control-what-now\u002F) ‚Äì CEOs may even be grilled on the topic during or after earning calls, [for example](https:\u002F\u002Fuk.finance.yahoo.com\u002Fnews\u002Fnoted-banking-analyst-mike-mayo-194435202.html). Therefore we must expect, as the crypto asset industry matures and becomes more institutionalized, a move towards a more standardized way of promoting transparency around the allocations of founders and founding teams. This research note highlights the levels of founding team compensation among three popular crypto assets ‚Äì Ethereum, Zcash, and 0x ‚Äì and argues for a greater level of transparency on this topic.\n\n# Data\n\nFor each of these three crypto assets, we break down the proportion of their supply which has been committed to the founding (or extended) team and analyze how that amount changes over time.\n\n\\\n_Ethereum_ \n\nAround 11.9 million ETH was allocated to the [Ethereum Development Fund](https:\u002F\u002Fetherscan.io\u002Faddress\u002F0xde0b295669a9fd93d5f28d9ec85e40f4cb697bae) (the fund which compensates founders and other team members, whilst also supporting the entire Ethereum ecosystem) within the genesis block of Ethereum. In addition, at the genesis block, 60 million ETH was allocated to those who had contributed to the crypto asset‚Äôs crowdsale ‚Äì giving the Ethereum Development Fund 16.5% of the asset‚Äôs total supply at the blockchain‚Äôs launch. The chart below shows how the Ethereum Development Fund‚Äôs account balance has changed over time.\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Facrypto1.html\" width=\"90%\" height=\"350\" frameBorder=\"0\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n_Zcash_\n\n Unlike Ethereum, wherein the founders received lump sums of ETH at the beginning of the crypto asset‚Äôs life, Zcash utilized a [founder‚Äôs reward](https:\u002F\u002Fz.cash\u002Fblog\u002Ffunding\u002F) where the Zcash company and Foundation ‚Äì as well as its founders and early backers ‚Äì will receive 20% of newly created Zcash for the first four years of the crypto asset‚Äôs existence ‚Äì a total of 2.1 million ZEC. The chart below shows the increase in the cumulative founder‚Äôs reward over time.\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Facrypto2.html\" width=\"90%\" height=\"350\" frameBorder=\"0\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\n\n_0x_\n\nSimilar to Zcash, for 0x the founding team‚Äôs compensation is spread out over four years with a 1-year cliff period. The founding team were entitled to 10% of the crypto asset‚Äôs total supply ‚Äì around 100 million ZRX. The image below outlines the [intended breakdown](https:\u002F\u002Fblog.0xproject.com\u002Fannouncing-the-0x-token-zrx-launch-d4c097d893c7) of the ZRX token allocation at launch.\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Facrypto3.html\" width=\"90%\" height=\"350\" frameBorder=\"0\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\nMoreover, we can plot the [vesting account‚Äôs](https:\u002F\u002Fetherscan.io\u002Faddress\u002F0xdb63d40c033d35e79cdbb21430f0fe10e9d97303) balance over time in a similar way to the charts plotted for both Ethereum and Zcash.\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Facrypto4.html\" width=\"90%\" height=\"350\" frameBorder=\"0\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\nIt was difficult to fairly compare compensation amounts between the three different crypto assets we focused on due to the differences in their distribution mechanisms. Our chosen method of comparison is to simply use the total amount of crypto assets allocated to the development and founding teams at the asset‚Äôs launch regardless of when exactly they will be distributed. For Ethereum, this would simply be the value of the Ethereum Development Fund.\n\nIn turn for Zcash, this would be the total founder‚Äôs reward and for 0x, this would be both the External Development Pool, Team Vesting Accounts, and the Multi-Signature wallet holdings. Both Zcash and 0x have known supply caps whilst Ethereum does not due to its ongoing inflation, as such we‚Äôve used the proportion of the supply each founding (and development) team would own once their various vesting periods had ended where applicable, to account for differences in monetary policy between the crypto assets. In Ethereum‚Äôs case, there was no known vesting period for the founding team so the proportion is measured at the asset‚Äôs genesis block.\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Facrypto5.html\" width=\"90%\" height=\"350\" frameBorder=\"0\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\nIt is dangerous to simply look at the chart above and assume that the allocation structure in Ethereum‚Äôs case was comparable (in fairness terms) to that of Zcash or better than that of 0x, since in the latter two‚Äôs structures the existence of vesting schedules helped ensure that founders could not simply dump the crypto asset on the market, whilst also disincentivizing them from leaving the project early. The lack of incentives for remaining at the crypto asset‚Äôs central organization was a problem in Ethereum as important early contributors like Joe Lubin, Gavin Wood, Jutta Steiner, Anthony di Iorio, and Aeron Buchanan left the Ethereum Foundation all within two years of the crypto asset‚Äôs launch.\n\n# Accountability\n\nAside from Ethereum, it was almost impossible to discern exactly what proportion of the founding team asset pools was allocated to specific co-founders. Moreover, the level of data required (such as crypto asset wallet addresses and allocation breakdowns) to do this analysis for more crypto assets is not currently available due to a lack of transparency from projects. Initiatives like the [Messari Registry](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.bloomberg.com\u002Fnews\u002Farticles\u002F2019-05-02\u002Ffidelity-survey-finds-institutional-investors-are-eyeing-crypto) have done a good job of improving on this point but the key data points needed for the independent analysis of founding team compensation within the industry still does not exist. It is for this reason that we suspect that issues such as a lack of appropriate vesting schedules and unfair founder compensation are likely to be extremely common within the industry. Without regulatory oversight on this matter, we doubt whether industry self-regulation can ever lead to an appropriate level of transparency and accountability.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThe information provided does not constitute a prospectus or other offering material and does not contain or constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of any offer to buy securities in any jurisdiction.\n\nSome of the information published herein may contain forward-looking statements.

We discussed how retail investors had been using those funds to access cryptoasset exposure at a steep premium to NAV compared to our line of [ETPs](https:\u002F\u002F21shares.com\u002Fproduct\u002Fabtc), available across Europe, which provides investors access to Bitcoin exposure without steep premiums. We had previously discussed how it was a common trade among [institutional investors](https:\u002F\u002Fdecrypt.co\u002F53121\u002Fthree-arrows-capital-grayscale-bitcoin-trust-holdings-1-3-billion) and [professional firms](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.coindesk.com\u002Fblockfi-owns-grayscale-bitcoin) who have been able to create new GBTC shares at NAV (thus avoiding acquiring exposure at a premium) and then (after a six month lockup period) have historically been able to sell their shares and benefit from the premium. Demand for this trade has been a critical reason behind GBTC‚Äôs explosive growth to-date ‚Äî though strong retail demand for Bitcoin exposure (at whatever premium) and organic demand for Bitcoin exposure from institutions have played an important role as well indirectly and directly, respectively. The viability of this trade has waned, however, as the chart below shows.\n\n![](\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Fskew_grayscale_bitcoin_trust_gbtc_premium.png)\n\nGBTC shares are now trading at a discount to NAV of -11.59%, indicating that demand for GBTC on the secondary market no longer massively outweighs the selling pressure of those institutions carrying out the premium trade. The premium has historically been damaging to retail investors because, as the premium decreases due to the trade from institutional investors, they can underperform Bitcoin or ETPs such as ours which closely tracks Bitcoin‚Äôs performance (1:1). The chart below demonstrates just that; over the last six months, the 21Shares Bitcoin ETP (ABTC) has returned 380.21% compared to 244.71% for GBTC.\n\n![](\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Fsg2021030518817.gif)\n\n**Reasons**\n\nThere are two key reasons why the premium for Grayscale‚Äôs Bitcoin product has disappeared and why, as such, the product now trades at a discount. The first reason is that retail investors are becoming increasingly aware of alternative products available for getting exposure to Bitcoin and cryptoassets, whether that be other investment trusts or potentially a Bitcoin ETP\u002FETF in the coming months or years. However, volumes for GBTC are still substantial, but this is more in line with a massive spike in interest for cryptoassets in recent months. Despite this fact, GBTC is currently trading at a discount to its NAV.\n\n![](\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Fskew_grayscale_bitcoin_trust_gbtc_daily_volume.png)\n\nThe second reason, and likely more critical, is that the Grayscale premium trade from institutional investors is increasingly crowded, resulting in a large amount of recently-unlocked GBTC shares being offloaded as a way for such investors to realise their gains.\n\n**Implications**\n\nThe primary implication from this is that if the discount of GBTC persists, the viability of the ‚ÄúGBTC premium trade‚Äù used by funds and entities such as Three Arrows Capital and BlockFi will likely fade away. In general, this will make it more difficult for institutional investors to use the trade to generate yield on their Bitcoin investments. This fact also points out that such investment trusts are not suitable vehicles for institutional-grade investment vehicles for Bitcoin investment.\n\nEurope has paved the way for institutional and retail investors to access Bitcoin exposure safely, cheap, and regulated through 21Shares‚Äô ETP suite, including the [21Shares Bitcoin ETP (ABTC | ISIN: CH0454664001)](https:\u002F\u002F21shares.com\u002Fproduct\u002Fabtc\u002F).

Since the second half of 2020, we have witnessed a range of institutions and companies get exposure to the asset class. Corporations like Square and recently Hong-kong listed company, [Meitu](https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002FDocumentEther\u002Fstatus\u002F1372207808557420545), university endowments like Harvard and Yale, and even cities like Miami are interested in adding bitcoin to their treasury reserves.

For example, during a [virtual panel](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=G5bVtzQt4Uc&ab_channel=CNBCTelevision) discussion on digital banking hosted by the Bank for International Settlement, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell mentioned that Bitcoin is more of a substitute for gold than a dollar replacement (*26:36*). The world is also waking up to the sophistication of the crypto infrastructure; on that note, the world's largest custodian bank, BNY Mellon, [invested](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.wsj.com\u002Farticles\u002Fbank-of-new-york-mellon-invests-in-crypto-startup-11616063404) in the $133 million financing round of FireBlocks, which will serve as the primary crypto custodian on behalf of BNY's clients.\n\nOn the final note, as institutional investment has become the dominant narrative related to Bitcoin's adoption, it is fair to admit that smaller players remain relatively unseen thus far in this cycle. But at 21Shares Research we like to investigate economic activity directly on the bitcoin blockchain and, based on that, we can‚Äôt be more optimistic about this current cycle as the wallets holding less than 1 BTC recently reached an all-time high ‚Äî beating out even the height of the 2017 bullet market.

The institutional adoption of Bitcoin has grown in tandem with the availability of institutional-grade investment vehicles such as investment trusts traded over the counter in the US, ETPs\u002FETNs in Europe, and ETFs in Canada as well as recently in Brazil. These investment vehicles represent alternatives and options for institutional investors that will eventually pick the one that fits into their mandate. There is a panoply of structures, in addition to those above, such as certificates like Coinshares‚Äô that have by design [expiration dates](https:\u002F\u002Fcoinshares.com\u002Fetps\u002Fxbt-provider\u002Fnews\u002Finvestor-faq-litecoin-xrp-certificates) and also lack independent market makers for liquidity, unlike ETPs and ETFs, as the issuer of certificates also transact in them, which to some extent involves counterparty risks.\\\n\\\nNonetheless, the rise of ETFs outside Europe doesn't preclude the unprecedented interest in 21Shares ETPs in Europe as our product suite is the most expansive in the world.

The entire industry is now valued at over $2 trillion, while in early January this year, it crossed the $1 trillion mark for the first time in history. In 3 months, the industry has doubled its entire value. To put things in perspective, it took Apple [about two years](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.npr.org\u002F2020\u002F08\u002F19\u002F903858871\u002Fapple-is-1st-2-trillion-american-company?t=1617718784057) from 2018 to 2020 to break the $2 trillion mark from $1 trillion in market value. Although the crypto industry is growing at a much greater pace, we are still in the early innings of the crypto-focused technologies‚Äô adoption lifecycle, with only over 100 million crypto users out of 4 billion Internet users ‚Äî around 2.5% of the Internet population. \n\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.mcauto-images-production.sendgrid.net\u002F3b7436794fe7d912\u002F9d5a7bee-c899-4185-87c0-fa60a846650c\u002F1072x700.png)\n\nFor the industry to reach over 1 billion crypto users, it will also require regulatory clarity and sound policies showing a clear understanding of the value proposition of crypto-enabled applications, which by design are trustless, open-source and accessible anywhere with an Internet connection. Most importantly, these policies should benefit the involved stakeholders of such applications and use cases ‚Äî and this is why CCI exists to educate and collaborate with policymakers around the world. \n\nTraditional service providers are already embracing technologies coming from the crypto industry. For example, [Visa](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.bloomberg.com\u002Fnews\u002Farticles\u002F2021-03-29\u002Fvisa-using-stablecoin-to-settle-transactions-in-lure-to-fintechs?utm_content=crypto&utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter) will eventually enable its network of consumers, businesses, banks and governments to use USD Coin (USDC), the fastest-growing digital currency of which the value is pegged to the US dollar ‚Äî while the transactions will settle over Ethereum. This endeavour is a testament to the fact that conventional finance seeks for tapping into the innovation behind the crypto infrastructure.

HMRC concluded the guideline with an overly optimistic line on cryptoassets: \"On its own, owning and using cryptoassets is not illegal in the UK and does not imply tax evasion or any other illegal activities.\"\n\nAs the industry matures, the CCI understands that due to the open-source nature of crypto use cases, it will ideally require a globally coordinated regulatory approach to treat crypto applications and protocols akin to the treatment of the [Internet protocol suite](https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FInternet_protocol_suite). At 21Shares, we will closely monitor all the efforts being made and leave a positive mark on that front.\n\nLearn more [here](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.wsj.com\u002Farticles\u002Ffidelity-square-coinbase-launch-bitcoin-trade-group-11617710402)."},{title:f,content:j}]}},{tags:[A],date:"2021-04-20T10:49:12.482Z",slug:"newsletter-issue-103-1",category:e,en:{title:"21Shares Research Newsletter ‚Äì Issue 104",sections:[{title:h,content:"The market-driving [news](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.bloomberg.com\u002Fnews\u002Farticles\u002F2021-04-12\u002Fcoinbase-sails-toward-100-billion-valuation-on-crypto-frenzy) of the week was Coinbase‚Äôs pivotal direct listing which saw the company initially go public at more than a $100B valuation ‚Äî before settling at a valuation of around $65B as of today. Coinbase‚Äôs listing represents a large milestone in the increasing legitimacy of the cryptoasset industry as it forces traditional finance to pay more attention to the lucrative business models facilitated by Bitcoin and blockchain technology.\n\nGiven the direct listing mechanism used by Coinbase, where the company did not issue new shares but rather investors and employees were free to sell their own shares on the market (with no lockup), Coinbase (ticker: COIN) fared poorly on the listing date.

However, he delved into potential stringent regulatory actions on stablecoins if they were widely used for payments. In this case, stablecoin issuers would need to be regulated like banks to operate in China\n\n**Why Does It Matter?**\n\nChina has taken a rather friendly tone towards Bitcoin with the deputy governor of their Central Bank indicating that Bitcoin is an investment alternative, akin to gold, rather than a threatening digital currency to their sovereignty. This positive stance on Bitcoin from Chinese officials, at this point, is no surprise. A few months ago, the Chinese State Media [indicated](https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002FQwQiao\u002Fstatus\u002F1338146048741609473) that the rise of Bitcoin will cause downward pressure on Gold. The chart below testifies that this trend is happening. The total known ETF holdings of gold have been on a sharp decline since Q3 2020 while the Bitcoin-to-gold spot ratio has been on a tear due to the fact that Bitcoin has experienced unprecedented institutional adoption demonstrated by its price action. \n\n![](http:\u002F\u002Fcdn.mcauto-images-production.sendgrid.net\u002F3b7436794fe7d912\u002Fd83a96ff-9a1a-48f0-a937-bb9b9fb007e5\u002F1442x864.png)\n\nFor example, Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock confessed to [CNBC](https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002FSquawkCNBC\u002Fstatus\u002F1382655364672393223) that Bitcoin will become a great asset class. Inflation concerns and climate risks take over the conversation between BlackRock and its clients such as sovereign wealth funds. As such, this is a testament to the fact that we are still in the early innings of the adoption of Bitcoin as an emerging store of value in the untapped market of wealth management accounting for almost [$90 trillion](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.investopedia.com\u002Farticles\u002Fprofessionals\u002F111115\u002Fhow-big-wealth-management-and-financial-advisor-industry.asp) in AUM. At the moment, Bitcoin is still in its price-discovery stage since the cryptoasset broke its previous all-time high of $19.9K. \n\nBlockchain technology also enables instantaneous transfers of synthetic US dollars which are usually called stablecoins or cryptodollars. These are ideal for payments to circumvent the daily volatility of Bitcoin especially in the case of a market correction as previously discussed in the Market Outlook section. However, stablecoins could represent a potential threat to the Digital Yuan efforts, China's CBDC, given the fact that their adoption happens [underground](https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002Felindinga\u002Fstatus\u002F1277619473785249799?s=20) in China. If stablecoins reach a significant size in transaction volume, China could contemplate the idea of a ban in this decade. \n\nWhile China seems to embrace Bitcoin as digital gold, their stance on stablecoins might turn out to be the opposite of the US. For example, Tesla, [Time Magazine](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.theblockcrypto.com\u002Flinked\u002F102166\u002Ftime-magazine-bitcoin-digital-subscription-payments), and [WeWork](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.wework.com\u002Fideas\u002Fnewsroom-landing-page\u002Fnewsroom\u002Fposts\u002Fwework-starts-utilizing-cryptocurrency-as-form-of-payment) will accept a handful of cryptoassets as a form of payment for their respective services. Though bitcoin is not an ideal channel for day-to-day payments, the product-market fit lies in stablecoins such as USD Coin (USDC) in this scenario. \n\nAt 21Shares, we also anticipate a more friendly regulatory environment in the US rather than in China. For instance, Gary Gensler, who taught a crypto course at MIT, was [sworn in](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.forbes.com\u002Fsites\u002Fjonathanponciano\u002F2021\u002F04\u002F14\u002Fgary-gensler-confirmed-sec-chairman\u002F) last week as the SEC Chairman, while Brian Brooks, former head of the OCC has been [appointed](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.wsj.com\u002Famp\u002Farticles\u002Fcryptocurrency-giant-binance-hires-former-top-bank-regulator-11618912800) CEO of the US entity of Binance ‚Äî the largest crypto exchange in the world. \n\nLearn more [here](https:\u002F\u002Fcryptobriefing.com\u002Fcentral-bank-china-will-regulate-bitcoin-investment-alternative\u002F)."},{title:f,content:j}]}},{tags:[A],date:"2021-04-27T11:12:39.963Z",slug:"newsletter-issue-103-2",category:e,en:{sections:[{title:h,content:"Following a difficult week and weekend within the cryptoasset market, Bitcoin and other large caps have largely recovered.

Tesla, Elon Musk‚Äôs electric vehicle manufacturer, had bought $1.5B worth of Bitcoin in January whilst allowing customers to use the cryptoasset to pay for its products.\\\nThe fact that the cryptoasset market was able to sustain a large amount of selling pressure, and the news of Tesla reducing its position, is a signal of the strong underlying bid for Bitcoin and the overall resilience of the market.

On the chart below, over 33% of that cohort bought BTC between 1 month and 3 months ago. Included in this portion of the market are long leveraged traders that got liquidated on unregulated venues where they can trade the underlying asset for over 100x. But there's also certainly active funds that perform rebalancing on a quarterly basis (ie, hedge funds).\n\nAs the number of small bitcoin holders (less than 1 BTC per address) has been on the rise since late December last year, it shouldn't come out as a surprise that some of these sellers are part of the retail cohort. Indeed, the price of Bitcoin is up 3x from $19,000 which triggers profit-taking across the board as we have seen in the case of Tesla.\n\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.mcauto-images-production.sendgrid.net\u002F3b7436794fe7d912\u002F0949120f-b48d-4c24-8dde-dd5366940a07\u002F1600x830.png)"},{title:w,content:"The returns of the top five crypto assets over the last week were as follows ‚Äî BTC (-4.48%), ETH (8.48%), BNB (-8.56%), DOT (-5.68%), and ADA (-2.28%).\n\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.mcauto-images-production.sendgrid.net\u002F3b7436794fe7d912\u002Fe6ef29bd-1e65-4abc-8685-c564c3597ffb\u002F1200x600.png)"},{title:_,content:"The performance of our line of ETPs over the last 30 days is as follows: ABTC (0.17%), AETH (51.15%), ABCH (67.27%), AXRP (122.23%), ABNB (114.86%), AXTZ (22.57%), HODL (8.26%), ABBA (5.43%), KEYS (9.42%), SBTC (-4.47%), and ADOT (2.55%).\n\nYou can learn more about our products [here](https:\u002F\u002F21shares.com\u002Fproduct\u002F '\\\u003Cspan style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#1155cc;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:underline;-webkit-text-decoration-skip:none;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\"\u003Ehere\\\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E').\n\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.mcauto-images-production.sendgrid.net\u002F3b7436794fe7d912\u002F35b0fc39-d953-40ce-8db1-c32d95958734\u002F1000x500.png)"},{title:y,content:"Did you get the chance to read our Cardano and Stellar primers?

Unlike other leading smart contract platforms such as Ethereum, Cardano powers its transaction settlement using a proof-of-stake algorithm, a structure considered less risky in terms of the potential for miners to attack the network. Cardano was developed by ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson and conducted its first settlements in 2017. Its native token, ADA, is currently ranked as the sixth-largest cryptocurrency globally with a total market cap exceeding $38 billion.\n\nStellar, meanwhile, is a purpose-built blockchain enabling the transfer of any assets and allowing developers to build low-cost financial services on the platform. Stellar was founded in 2014 by Jeb McCaleb, co-founder of Ripple, and has since processed more than 450 million operations made by over 4 million users. Its native token, lumen (XLM), a utility token for the payment of the platform‚Äôs transaction fees, is currently ranked as the seventeenth-largest cryptocurrency globally with a market cap of around $10.5bn.\n\nThe ETPs offer institutional investors easy access to ADA and XLM through liquid, regulated vehicles without the technical challenges of setting up private keys or crypto wallets. The ETPs use full direct, so-called ‚Äòphysical‚Äô replication with each share being 100% collateralized by a corresponding investment in ADA or XLM. Each unit of the Cardano and Stellar ETPs will be backed by approximately 16 ADA and 40 XLM, respectively, at launch.\n\nPhysical (in a digital sense) tokens are stored using institutional-grade custody solutions with Kingdom Trust and Coinbase providing custody services for ADA and XLM respectively. Both ETPs come with management fees of 2.50%.\n\nLearn more [here](https:\u002F\u002Fcryptobriefing.com\u002Fcentral-bank-china-will-regulate-bitcoin-investment-alternative\u002F)."},{title:f,content:j}],title:"21Shares Research Newsletter ‚Äì Issue 105"}},{tags:[A],date:"2021-04-13T11:14:53.798Z",slug:"newsletter-issue-103",category:e,en:{title:"21Shares Research Newsletter ‚Äì Issue 103",sections:[{title:h,content:"21Shares successfully carried out a stock split of our range of crypto ETPs which has been effective since yesterday, April 12th.

Xi made the remarks in a meeting with the political bureau of the party's Central Committee. The meeting is part of a workshop series held regularly by the Central Committee and Thursday's workshop aimed at learning the current state and future development of blockchain technology. This is presumably the first time the party's central committee collectively studied blockchain technology.\n\nXi stressed that China already has a solid foundation to develop blockchain technology. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen and let China \"take the leading position in the emerging field of blockchain. The country needs to accelerate the standardization of blockchain research, which will, in turn, give China more power in setting rules and standards internationally\", Xi said. According to Xi, China will also promote the integration of blockchain technology with the real-world economy and solve real problems in the existing banking and financial systems.\n\n**Why Does This Matter?**\n\nIt should not come as a surprise that China continues to push forward with its \"blockchain\" efforts, but perhaps it is slightly surprising that President Xi Jinping would take such a public stance on the industry during a Communist Party of China's Central Committee meeting. Perhaps, the biggest example of China's increased focus on blockchain technology is the development of its own digital currency ‚Äî the Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP) initiative.\n\nAs reported by Dovey Wan, Founding Partner at Primitive Ventures, the news had a large effect on mainstream interest in Bitcoin and blockchain technology within China.

The seized funds, which amount to $350 million, reportedly belonged to Crypto SP. Z O.O. and NESP SP.

After the publication of this story, Vivien Khoo, deputy COO of BitMEX, told The Block that the email was sent to ‚Äúthe majority of our users, however not all were affected,‚Äù adding that the issue occurred due to \"an error in the software script used to send the emails.‚Äù Khoo further said that no other personal data or account information has been disclosed.\n\n**Why Does This Matter?**\n\nThe news of the BitMEX customer data leak is a reminder of the high-risk nature of the security and operational practices of many exchanges given the relative ease through which several data points (i.e. a customer's email, phone number, or password) could lead to the loss of considerable amounts of money. Such a data breach means that BitMEX's users have an increased chance of being subject to a phishing attack or hacks given that their emails are likely linked to other accounts and profiles.

The paper uses a variety of techniques and heuristics to argue that, instead of the purchases of Tether being a consequence of increases or expectations of an increase in Bitcoin prices (the demand-driven thesis), instead the increases in Bitcoin prices were driven by purchases of Tether (the supply-driven thesis).\n\nThe main disagreement from those in the industry thus far has been over the direction of the causal link between changes in Tether supply and changes in Bitcoin's price. In next week's edition of this newsletter, we'll do a deeper dive into the findings of the report and the statistical significance of Griffin and Shams' analysis.

Griffin and Amin Shams which alleged that the Bitcoin and the wider crypto asset market had been manipulated by a single entity through the printing of tether throughout the bull market of 2017.\n\nAs we mentioned last week, the paper was met by scepticism by many in the industry and Tether themselves have since come out to criticise and deny the findings of the report.\n\nGiven its length, it's likely that very few in the industry have actually taken the time to read the paper in length but our research team has. The main argument of the paper is as follows:\n\nThere are two plausible arguments for the relationship between tether issuance and Bitcoin price returns ‚Äî the demand-driven hypothesis and the supply-driven hypothesis\n\nThe demand-driven hypothesis is where \"Tether is driven by legitimate demand from investors who use Tether as a medium of exchange to enter their fiat capital into the crypto space because it is \\[a] digital currency with the stability of the dollar ‚Äòpeg.‚Äô In this case, the price impact of Tether reflects natural market demand.\"\n\nThe supply-driven hypothesis is where \"Bitfinex prints Tether regardless of the demand from cash investors. In this case, additional supply of Tether can create ... inflation in \\[the] price of Bitcoin that is not from a genuine capital flow.\"\n\n![Aggregate Flow of Tether between Major Addresses. Source: Griffin and Shams (2019)](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Fimage.png)\n\nGriffin and Shams use several heuristics to argue for the supply-driven hypothesis as opposed to the demand-driven hypothesis: the timing of the issuances of tether and increases in Bitcoin prices, Bitcoin address clustering to ostensibly discern that a single entity is behind the manipulation, strongly negative end-of-month returns during months when tether is issued, and clusters of Bitcoin purchases around round numbers on Bitfinex during months of tether issuance\n\nAs Elaine Ou pointed out in her article for Bloomberg, the authors of the paper draw too strong conclusions from the data they have. For example, the authors make the argument that, on days of tether issuance, the flows of capital from tether to Bitcoin significantly increases around round price thresholds ‚Äî to suggest that a single entity is attempting to prop the price of Bitcoin up by relying on the cognitive biases of traders. A much simpler argument would be that, as the authors mention but dismiss, that accounts associated with Bitfinex and tether wallets ‚Äî whether they be Bitfinex-based market makers or \"whales\" who use Bitfinex ‚Äî are also subject to biases to round numbers.\n\nIn addition, the evidence to suggest that the behaviour described in the paper was driven by a single entity ‚Äî dubbed \"1LSg\" ‚Äî is inconclusive as the paper doesn't consider the possibility that the address in question is simply used as a custodial address, representing the funds of many individual users on Bitfinex ‚Äî a common practice for crypto asset exchanges.\n\nThe difficulty with such analysis is that it is almost impossible to conclusively prove such a case of market manipulation without data on tether and Bitfinex's internal books as well as data from their various payment providers ‚Äî it was this kind of detail which allowed researchers to uncover evidence suggesting that Bitcoin's price was manipulated on Mt. Gox in 2014.\n\nOur research team will keep abreast of further developments in stories around Tether and Bitfinex so stay glued to our weekly research newsletter!"},{title:"Podcast ‚Äî Consumable Digital Commodities",content:"\u003Ciframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"200\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fplaylist.megaphone.fm?e=BWG5616556410\" width=\"100%\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\n\nIn this week's episode, the 21Shares team is joined by Dr. [Stephen McKeon](https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002Fsbmckeon?lang=en) (Partner at [Collaborative Fund](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.collaborativefund.com\u002F)) to discuss the emergence of digital commodities and how blockchain technology is used to democratize these new types of commodities which were previously exclusively supplied by large centralized entities.\n\nFrom the 21Shares team, the participants are Ophelia Snyder, Hany Rashwan and Greg Shaheen.

However, despite this Bakkt has a unique selling point given the easy access the Bakkt Warehouse offers to Bakkt's futures trading facilities and the firm's close ties to its parent, the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE).\n\nLearn more [here](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.coindesk.com\u002Fbakkt-expands-bitcoin-custody-service-beyond-futures-trading-clients)."},{title:"News ‚Äî Bitmain‚Äôs Ousted Co-founder Micree Zhan Says He Will Take Legal Action to Return to the Firm | The Block",content:"**What Happened?**\n\nMicree Zhan, co-founder of crypto asset mining giant Bitmain, was abruptly ousted from the company last week.

As we've noted, one can only estimate the Bitcoin network's hashrate through the use of its current [difficulty](https:\u002F\u002Fen.bitcoin.it\u002Fwiki\u002FDifficulty) and the [average time](https:\u002F\u002Fdecrypt.co\u002F9644\u002Fwhy-bitcoin-hashrate-didnt-crash-30-yesterday) between the creation of new blocks in the Bitcoin blockchain.

However, there are arguments to suggest that Bitcoin could also give society significant benefits by helping \"bank the unbanked\" and give billions of people access to financial markets, which the traditional financial has thus far failed to do.

With the \"cornerstone\" funding in place, the EIF said private investors are expected to bring up to ‚Ç¨300 million ($331 million) into the fund, while the total could rise further from next year, with national promotional banks being able to co-invest under the scheme.\n\nSifted [reports](https:\u002F\u002Fsifted.eu\u002Farticles\u002Feu-2bn-ai-blockchain-fund\u002F) that the fund could ultimately raise up to ‚Ç¨2 billion ($2.2 billion) under the InvestEU Programme. According to the post, the EU already spends plenty on blockchain (expected spending for 2019 is $674 million), but that is mostly directed toward research and proof-of-concepts.\n\n**Why Does This Matter?**\n\nA growing trend over the last year has been efforts by nations such as the United States or China to take an active role in promoting and facilitating innovation and business in key areas such as artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. This can be seen in the context of some in the academic sphere that have [argued](https:\u002F\u002Fqz.com\u002F1669346\u002Fmariana-mazzucatos-plan-to-use-governments-to-save-capitalism-from-itself\u002F) that, historically, governments have had an extremely important role in technology innovation ‚Äî for example, the United States Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) had a hand in the creation of ARPNET, the predecessor to the internet, GPS, and played roles in the formative technologies that led to inventions like Siri, Unix, and Google Maps.\n\nOn this premise, it would be reasonable to expect that governments may have an important role to play in the development of blockchain technology and crypto assets ‚Äî initiatives like China's digital currency and suggestions of a similar initiative in Europe certainly give credence to that. However, the fact that the crypto asset industry has generally been predicated on a deep skepticism of state involvement and governments in general certainly complicates matters ‚Äî what initially attracted people to Bitcoin was the ability it gave people to transact value without requiring the consent of a trusted third party like a central bank or government. It is unclear how one can square the ideological tension between the industry's libertarian roots and the ability of governments to help spur innovation, though we can expect the launch of state-run digital assets in the next few years to bring that debate to the center stage of discussions within the industry.\n\nThe chart below shows the total estimated spend of the US, EU, and China on blockchain-related initiatives according to data from the [International Data Corporation](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.idc.com\u002Fgetdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS45429719). As we can see, the United States is the leader in blockchain spending with an estimated $1.1 billion in 2019 compared to $661 million in Western Europe and $304 million in China ‚Äî though we can imagine both Western Europe and China catching up due to their large government initiatives in the space.\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\"100%\" height=\"520\" src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002F20191126graph3.html\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\nLearn more [here](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.coindesk.com\u002Feu-launches-estimated-e400m-blockchain-ai-fund-to-avoid-lagging-us-china)."},{title:"News ‚Äî Bakkt to Launch Cash-settled Bitcoin Futures Next Month in Singapore | The Block",content:"**What Happened?**\n\nBakkt, a provider of physically-settled bitcoin futures contracts, has officially announced the launch of cash-settled bitcoin futures.

The differences between each token's economic model affect its economic, valuation, and regulatory status and as such is of the utmost importance for anyone interested in the crypto asset industry.\n\nTune in to this week's episode to learn about token sale regulation and crypto asset economic models ‚Äî two of the most cutting edge topics within the sector.\n\nReading Materials:\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ‚Äî [SEC Orders Blockchain Company to Pay $24 Million Penalty for Unregistered ICO](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.sec.gov\u002Fnews\u002Fpress-release\u002F2019-202); Karen E.

The trans-Atlantic request was revealed in a trove of documents filed by the SEC last Friday with the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of New York.\n\nThe agency is seeking to halt the launch of TON, Telegram‚Äôs ambitious blockchain project, and the issuance of TON‚Äôs tokens, named grams.

According to the Friday filing, the SEC is seeking Hyman‚Äôs testimony as he has been closely involved in raising funds for TON and communicated with ‚Äúover a dozen‚Äù investors. Telegram CEO Pavel Durov described Hyman in January 2018 as the chief investment advisor at Telegram and the person who ‚Äúruns the distribution of Grams,‚Äù the SEC says.\n\n**Why does this matter?**\n\nAs CoinDesk noted, Telegram is due to meet the SEC in court on February 18-19, 2020. Since the news broke several months ago on the SEC's investigation into Telegram which halted the continuation of their $1.7B fundraise, the SEC has continued its investigation into the project and Telegram has, as a result struggled to launch its TON blockchain ‚Äî despite its original launch date of October 31.\n\nIt is difficult to understand how such a case will pan out but it is interesting to put this news in the context of the most recent episode of our podcast, Understanding Tokens ‚Äî Regulation and Economic Models, where we discussed how Block.one's willingness to settle with the SEC ‚Äî in contrast to Kik's desire to fight their case ‚Äî led to a relatively favourable outcome for the former (i.e. a settlement amount which was a fraction of the amount raised in the token sale) whilst Kik has suffered as a result. The chart below plots the industry's largest token sales where the $1.7B raised by Telegram ranks as the second-largest amount after Block.one's fundraise for their EOS token.\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\"100%\" height=\"520\" src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Ftweet20191209.html\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\nLearn more [here](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.coindesk.com\u002Fsec-reveals-telegrams-communications-with-investors-seeks-to-question-advisor)."},{title:"News ‚Äî Ethereum‚Äôs Istanbul Hard Fork Is Now Live | CoinDesk",content:"**What happened?**\n\nEthereum has successfully completed the Istanbul hard fork. Hitting at block number 9,069,000, the systemwide upgrade is the network‚Äôs third in 2019, following February‚Äôs St. Petersburg and Constantinople hard forks. The months-long process culminated at 0:25 UTC on Sunday.\n\nAnother iteration of Ethereum 1.x, Istanbul is the network‚Äôs eighth hard fork overall with the first code changes being approved in June 2019 (ETH 2.0, the network‚Äôs major transition to proof-of-stake (PoS), is [expected](https:\u002F\u002Fdocs.ethhub.io\u002Fethereum-roadmap\u002Fethereum-2.0\u002Feth-2.0-phases\u002F) to be completed by 2021). Being non-contentious, all ethereum clients ‚Äì which host and independently upgrade the ethereum protocol themselves ‚Äì have agreed to the new software.\n\n**Why does this matter?**\n\nAccording to a [blog post](https:\u002F\u002Fconsensys.net\u002Fblog\u002Fnews\u002Feverything-you-need-to-know-about-the-istanbul-hard-fork\u002F) from Consensys, the main issues addressed by the hard fork are as follows: denial-of-service (DDoS) attack resilience (EIP 1344), interoperability with equihash-based proof-of-work (PoW) cryptocurrencies such as zcash (EIP 152), gas costs (EIPs 1108, 2028, 2200). As such, the hard fork can be expected to have a positive impact on Ethereum's ability to function.\n\nIn addition, some of the reductions in gas costs (i.e. the amount users pay for transactions and smart contracts) will massively improve the viability of certain \"layer-2\" scalability solutions on Ethereum, as [noted](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.theblockcrypto.com\u002Fgenesis\u002F44740\u002Foptimistic-rollup-explained) by The Block's analyst Matteo Leibowitz.\n\nAn unfortunate side effect of the hard fork has been an increase in the failure of smart contract \"calls\" (transactions which interact with smart contracts) as the chart below clearly demonstrates. On the day of the hard fork, December 8, the Ethereum network saw a brief spike in failed transactions; though there have been many days in Ethereum's past where there have been much greater amounts of failed transactions.\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\"100%\" height=\"520\" src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002F20191210graph2-5.html\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\nLearn more [here](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.coindesk.com\u002Fethereums-istanbul-hard-fork-is-now-live)."},{title:"News ‚Äî Bakkt Has Launched 2 New Trading Products, And It Sheds Light On The Firm's 2020 Vision | The Block",content:"**What happened?**\n\nIt's not yet clear who will lead Bakkt going into 2020, but the firm's product roadmap for the new year is somewhat apparent.

Six people tied to PlusToken were arrested and extradited to China from Vanuatu, where Beijing claimed the company operated a Ponzi scheme. Chainalysis said it was able to track down $2 billion in cryptocurrencies taken from victims, with a lot of that going to other ‚Äúinvestors‚Äù ‚Äì a hallmark of traditional pyramid schemes.\n\n**Why does this matter?**\n\nIn previous weeks we have mentioned Chainalysis and their role as a data analytics and surveillance firm for blockchain data. As mentioned, PlusToken was an infamous scam that advertised itself as a crypto asset wallet which rewarded users with high rates of return if they purchased the wallet‚Äôs associated PLUS crypto asset tokens with Bitcoin or Ethereum. The scammers claimed those returns would be generated by ‚Äúexchange profit, mining income, and referral benefits.‚Äù\n\nChainalysis used graph analysis to aid in their research into the provenance of the funds from the PlusToken scam as the chart below shows.\n\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Fchainalysis1.png)\n\nThe Chainalysis analysis attempted to understand whether PlusToken's liquidations of its stolen funds were a driver of Bitcoin's volatility over the last few months. Their hypotheses were that: (1) **they expect that any uptick in on-chain volume would be followed by an uptick in trade volume, as OTC traders receive Bitcoin from PlusToken wallets and subsequently exchange it for Tether**; and (2) **they expect Bitcoin‚Äôs price to fall soon after those upticks in on-chain and trade volume, as more Bitcoin is being unloaded onto the market**.\n\nBy analysing both on-chain volumes from PlusToken-associated wallets to OTC brokers and BTC-USDT traders, as well as their relationships with Bitcoin's price, Chainalysis ascertained that the two variables are correlated to drops in Bitcoin's price ‚Äî as the two charts show below.\n\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Fchainalysis2.png)\n\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Fchainalysis3.png)\n\nProving that this correlation is indicative of a causal relationship between PlusToken liquidations and drops in Bitcoin's price is a slightly more difficult task. On this point, the analysis is able to show that there is a slightly statistically significant relationship between PlusToken transfers to OTC brokers and Bitcoin price volatility between September 23 and 28.\n\nThe market drop over the last year is likely a response to worries about further liquidations by PlusToken; this seems like an understandable concern as, according to Chainalysis, around 790,000 ETH and 20,000 BTC of the stolen funds have yet to be liquidated.\n\nLearn more [here](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.coindesk.com\u002Fchainalysis-report-on-plustoken-scammers-blamed-for-mondays-crypto-selloff)."},{title:"News ‚Äî SEC Charges Shopin for Allegedly Defrauding Investors of $42M in An Unregistered ICO | The Block",content:"**What happened?**\n\nCryptocurrency firm Shopin and its CEO Eran Eyal have been charged by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for allegedly defrauding hundreds of investors in a $42 million initial coin offering (ICO).\n\nAccording to the [allegation](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.sec.gov\u002Fnews\u002Fpress-release\u002F2019-259), Eyal and his company sold Shopin Tokens in an unregistered securities offering from August 2017 to April 2018, under the premise that the funds would be used to generate a blockchain-based database for shopper profiles.

It is an apt time to reconsider Bitcoin's role as a safe haven and several analysts already have done just that; for example, Bradley Keoun from CoinDesk [wrote](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.coindesk.com\u002Fbitcoin-as-a-safe-haven-us-iran-tensions-rekindle-debate) \"For some market analysts and investors, bitcoin‚Äôs rally served to underscore the digital asset‚Äôs perceived value as a hedge against inflation, historically an economic consequence of major wars\".\n\nThere are two pieces of evidence needed to confirm such an argument: (1) Proof that Bitcoin could theoretically act as a useful safe haven asset; (2) Proof that the market actually is treating Bitcoin like a safe haven asset. The argument and evidence for (1) is much stronger than that of (2) and, ultimately, (2) is what really decides how Bitcoin's price reacts to geopolitical uncertainty in the long term and therefore is the primary driver of its Bitcoin's long-term use as a store of value.\n\nWe have [talked](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.21Shares.com\u002Fresearch\u002Four-thesis-for-crypto) before about how Bitcoin's limited supply, economic security, decentralization, and censorship resistance make it theoretically an ideal safe haven asset.\n\nThe chart below shows Bitcoin's rolling 30-day correlation with GLD (the most popular gold ETF). We would expect that, if Bitcoin fulfilled a similar safe haven function as gold, the two assets would increasingly demonstrate a strong correlation.\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\"100%\" height=\"520\" src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002F20200107graph3.html\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\nAs one can see, there has been no discernible trend over time in the BTC-GLD rolling correlation and, for the most part, the relationship almost looks like white noise. There is the other point that, it has not just been Bitcoin which has surged since US-Iran tensions reached their boiling point ‚Äî instead the entire market has moved upwards. Bitcoin has experienced similar market volatility on days without changes in macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions and, while it is undoubtedly true that some investors have purchased Bitcoin, as of late, as a hedge against a global meltdown, this surge in-of-itself does not necessarily prove Bitcoin can now be seen as the de facto safe haven asset.\n\nLooking at LocalBitcoin's volume for Iran in USD terms shows how Bitcoin, for many people, is still not a viable safe haven despite the theoretical grounds for it to be. As others have [pointed](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.coindesk.com\u002Fbitcoin-as-a-safe-haven-us-iran-tensions-rekindle-debate) out, there has not been a large spike in demand for Bitcoin in Iran despite increased tensions and uncertainty as the graph below shows.\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\"100%\" height=\"520\" src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Flocalbitcoinirr1.png\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\nThe fact that people are credibly discussing Bitcoin as a safe haven asset shows just how far the industry has come.

The Telegram Open Network will continue to struggle launching, just like Libra, and when\u002Fif it does launch it may be quite unrecognizable from the vision painted by the Telegram CEO's elder brother and fellow Telegram co-founder, Dr. Nikolai Durov, in the project's white paper.\n\nLearn more [here](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.coindesk.com\u002Ftelegram-tries-to-clarify-gram-crypto-project-amid-ongoing-sec-fight)."},{title:"News ‚Äî Binance CEO Says Some ‚ÄòMajor‚Äô Strategic Acquisitions Are in The Works for 2020 | The Block",content:"**What happened?**\n\nAfter acquiring several firms last year, Binance CEO Changpeng ‚ÄúCZ‚Äù Zhao has now said that some more ‚Äúmajor‚Äù strategic acquisitions are in the works for 2020.\n\n‚ÄúWe always have a number of strategic acquisition discussions in the works, a couple of them are major and will have a significant impact.

It is common as a new industry matures and becomes increasingly institutionalised that a period of consolidation happens. Within the social media and networking industry: Facebook bought WhatsApp and Instagram, Google bought Waze, Twitter bought Vine, Microsoft bought Yammer, and Yahoo bought Tumblr all within the period of 2012-2014. As incumbents' balance sheets swell within a new industry as they consolidate existing profitable verticals, they often seek to acquire smaller and more innovative firms to maintain their competitive streak.\n\nWhile no crypto asset company is nearly the size of the aforementioned networking incumbents, several such as Coinbase and Binance are likely to have large sums of cash or cash-equivalents on their balance sheet; as such CZ's comments seem natural. In fact, there were [rumours](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.coindesk.com\u002Fcorrection-coinbase-tagomi-deny-acquisition) of a planned acquisition of Tagomi ‚Äî a crypto asset prime broker ‚Äî by Coinbase and whilst the news was denied by both parties, we're likely to hear a number of similar stories going forward. In addition, the crypto asset industry is one where only one of the dominant American or Chinese technology monopolies has an active presence so there remains the possibility that more could enter ‚Äî likely through acquisitions or acqui-hires as Facebook [did](https:\u002F\u002Fmashable.com\u002Farticle\u002Ffacebook-acquires-blockchain-team-chainspace\u002F).\n\nExcess consolidation or monopolization can be extremely detrimental for industries, as well as stifling for innovation, and should be an issue to watch going forward given how ostensibly antithetical it is to the industry's belief in decentralization. It remains to be seen how concentration of industrial power within the industry will develop over time but the number and size of acquisitions are the key data points to watch in 2020.\n\nRead more[ here](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.theblockcrypto.com\u002Fpost\u002F51969\u002Fbinance-ceo-says-some-major-strategic-acquisitions-are-in-the-works-for-2020)."},{title:f,content:ai}]},slug:"newsletter-issue-36"},{name:pS,date:"2020-01-14T13:00:00.000Z",category:e,tags:[],en:{title:pS,sections:[{title:h,content:"One unavoidable trend over the last year within the crypto asset market has been the rapid growth of the Bitcoin derivatives market.

On the other hand, FTX largely exists within an unregulated framework and is preferred by likely primarily other quantitative funds, market makers, as well as sophisticated retail investors.\n\nThe fact that both sides of the spectrum have decided to launch bitcoin options goes to show the industry's sentiment to the potential margins still available within the crypto asset derivatives market.

One data point which suggests this is the relatively little competition among mining pools for Bitcoin SV compared to Bitcoin as we show below ‚Äî it is likely the 'unknown' segments in both cases represent other large mining entities for the most part.\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\"100%\" height=\"520\" src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002F20200121graph5.html\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\nThere is evidence to suggest that recent price movements could have been driven primarily by entities who had received mining rewards since the fork, rather than by organic demand from new BSV investors. Thanks to the open nature of blockchains we can estimate the average time investors hold BTC or BSV before they then transact with it again ‚Äî whether to buy a good, transfer holdings to a new wallet, or sell the asset. Whilst not a perfect measure, this metric ‚Äî typically called \"Dormancy\" ‚Äî is useful in understanding the holding habits of investors for an asset like BSV.\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\"100%\" height=\"520\" src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002F20200121graph4.html\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\nBSV's dormancy statistic is noticeably higher than BTC's, at around 13 days compared to 8 days for BTC. All things being equal, the higher the dormancy the older coins are being transacted on that day for BSV than BTC, which in turn means that longer-term investors of BSV are releasing their coins into circulation at a higher rate than that of BTC currently. This is especially noticeable, as previously mentioned, due to the fact that many of the oldest holders of BSV ‚Äî those who held BTC before the fork in November 2018 ‚Äî may not even have access to the asset anymore, or if they did will have likely sold their holdings by now.\n\nGiven the nature of BSV's price surge likely being driven by longer-term investors (such as miners), it is unlikely its performance is sustainable in the following months.

The launch of his foundation to promote dollar-based CBDC efforts is undeniably a reaction to the efforts coming from China, as well as perhaps fears over Facebook's Libra.

It enables investors to capture falling price movements in Bitcoin BTC via their traditional broker or bank. In contrast to shorting, which is usually associated with high lending costs (or margin calls), the inverse ETP is reset at the end of each day and the performance is not rolled over to the next day. Thus, it is ideally suited to capture short term price movements of Bitcoin for a short recommended period. With the SBTC tracker, investors can immediately and securely capitalize on falling adverse price movements of the largest and most liquid digital asset.\n\nOur CEO Hany Rashwan was quoted as saying: ‚ÄúWe have worked hard to be in a position to launch the first inverse Bitcoin ETP on a regulated trading venue here in Switzerland. 21Shares offers an existing suite of long investment products for a variety of crypto assets, however, the one missing puzzle was to deliver a product to capitalize on negative price movements.‚Äù\n\nLearn more about the product [here](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.21Shares.com\u002Fproduct\u002Fsbtc)."},{title:"News ‚Äî Ripple‚Äôs Brad Garlinghouse Hints Firm May Seek IPO Within 12 Months | CoinDesk",content:"**What happened?**\n\nRipple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said an initial public offering (IPO) is seen as the ‚Äúnatural evolution for the company,‚Äù perhaps even this year. ‚ÄúI think over the next 12 months you‚Äôre definitely going to see IPOs in the crypto, blockchain space.

In his mind there were no obvious means for the Libra Association to become profitable or make money from its users; \"When you don't understand how money get\\[s] made, it gets made in ways you don't like\" he said.\n\nNone of these concerns is out of the norm and many have been mentioned by Libra-skeptics within the crypto asset industry; for example, Jill Carlson, investor at Slow Ventures and co-founder of the [Open Money Initiative](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.openmoneyinitiative.org\u002F), [discussed](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.bloomberg.com\u002Fnews\u002Faudio\u002F2019-07-26\u002Fhow-people-are-using-cryptocurrency-in-venezuela-podcast) some of the issues with the financial inclusion narrative perpetuated by both Libra and those within the crypto asset industry.\n\nIt is likely that many, if not all the current and former members of the Libra Association have had similar concerns which are important to note as if we take Banga at his word, extend much further than just regulatory risks ‚Äî perhaps. therefore, presenting existential hurdles for Libra, even if it were to successfully launch.\n\nLearn more [here](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.coindesk.com\u002Fmastercard-left-libra-association-on-regulatory-and-viability-concerns-says-ceo)."},{title:"News ‚Äî Chainalysis Report Shows Criminal Uses of Bitcoin Doubled from 2018 to 2019 in BTC Terms | CoinDesk",content:"**What happened?**\n\nChainalysis's 2020 \"[State of Crypto Crime](https:\u002F\u002Fgo.chainalysis.com\u002Frs\u002F503-FAP-074\u002Fimages\u002F2020-Crypto-Crime-Report.pdf)\" report, published Wednesday, offers an analysis of illicit activities last year, contrasting 2019's actions with previous years. Chainalysis found that while the amount of bitcoin sent from criminal entities doubled between 2018 and the end of 2019, it still accounts for just 0.08 percent of the total number of bitcoin transactions last year.\n\nWhile exchange hacks and thefts dominated headlines last year, ‚Äúscams were by far the highest-earning category of crypto crime in 2019,‚Äù the report said. ‚ÄúCryptocurrency scams represent a significant danger to consumer protection, and the growth of this activity in 2019 calls for increased action from regulators, law enforcement and exchanges alike.‚Äù\n\n**Why does this matter?**\n\nThere are two graphs which most accurately summarize the findings of the Chainalysis report.

One of the reasons for the cooldown of the token sale and token market was fear and uncertainty from the issuer on whether or not their tokens where safe from enforcement action. This fact has been one of the reasons why an increasing amount of activity within the space ‚Äî such as the derivatives market ‚Äî has taken place outside of the United States.\n\nCommissioner Pierce's proposal could potentially reverse this trend and make it easier for businesses, especially those in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) ecosystem to prosper. The proposal certainly will have a number of hurdles to clear, as [pointed out](https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002Fprestonjbyrne\u002Fstatus\u002F1225466066463272961) by well-known crypto lawyer Preston Byrne. Noticeably, the process by which a development team could sufficiently \"decentralize\" themselves within 3 years seems vague.

There has been a growth of nearly 100% since the start of this year as the amount locked was $670.77 million as of Dec. 31, 2019, according to [DeFi Pulse](https:\u002F\u002Fdefipulse.com\u002F). Maker, the Ethereum-based lending protocol, remains the leader in the space with nearly 60% dominance.\n\n**Why Does It Matter?**\n\nHitting the $1 billion mark is a proud moment for the DeFi community which in the last two years has grown from nothing into the most vibrant aspect of Ethereum. The chart below shows DeFi's growth in value since late 2017. One interesting thing to note is how much dominance the Maker\u002FDai stablecoin project has over DeFi; currently, as previously mentioned, Maker accounts for around 60% of DeFi and the Dai stablecoin forms a significant amount of the value and volumes of other popular DeFi projects like Compound.\n\nAs such, in some regards, despite the fact that the news of DeFi's growth is undoubtedly positive, it also shines a light on potential sources of systemic risk within the sector ‚Äî with the obvious one being DeFi's extreme reliance on the Maker\u002FDai stablecoin system.\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\"100%\" height=\"520\" src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002F20200211Graph3.html\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\nLearn more [here](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.theblockcrypto.com\u002Fpost\u002F55212\u002Fvalue-locked-into-defi-protocols-has-crossed-1-billion)."},{title:"News ‚Äî Investors Can Now Trade Reelection Futures Contracts for President Trump, Bernie Sanders, and Pete Buttigieg | The Block",content:"**What Happened?**\n\nCrypto asset derivatives exchange FTX has added a new futures contract, TRUMP-2020 (TRUMP), for users to monetize their prediction of the 2020 U.S. presidential election results.

While the six options currently available have only been trading for two days together, they already give us an indication of the probabilities the markets are assigning to the different candidates. As of today, the TRUMP contracts are priced at $0.663, compared to $0.196 for BERNIE contracts, and $0.059 for PETE contracts. We show the breakdown of the market's implied election predictions in the chart below.\n\nInterestingly, prediction markets have been touted as a classical use case of smart contracts on platforms like Ethereum but FTX was able to launch theirs without the use of tokenization ‚Äî but rather their own internal system for the collateralization and payouts of futures contracts, as their CEO [pointed out](https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002FSBF_Alameda\u002Fstatus\u002F1226889277738340353).

As the company failed to spot this soon enough to remedy the situation, the snowball has grown even larger since the beginning of 2019.\n\n**Why Does It Matter?**\n\nGiven the lack of information provided by Zhang about the exact reasons for the insolvency, it is extremely easy for one to not digest the explanation given in the best faith ‚Äî especially given the industry's history of exchanges becoming insolvent under dubious circumstances. It remains to be seen what the outcome of the insolvency are likely to be but we can imagine the reported loss is likely to be shared equally among users.\n\nOne likely long-term consequence of this hack and the others over the last few years is that, whether due to consumer demands or regulatory intervention, exchanges are likely to be forced to post Proofs of Reserve ‚Äî data which proves their solvency. This would be a necessary step to ensure that exchanges aren't able to take advantage of users by not holding full reserves; certain exchanges such as Kraken have already begun using Proofs of Reserve in order to instil user confidence.\n\nLearn more [here](https:\u002F\u002Furl1861.amun.com\u002Fls\u002Fclick?upn=c7riRqhfexRyaQmWj4xmkT-2Be8-2Bir0-2BKQF-2BY2JZ7o0zrca3s591-2B0e1yu728eGH6uOwOW1ncwc5cZElYYpEJ1I46qV4Ma59D2qu3IP-2BsK6uG70f-2BYb8CFoknX-2B1-2Fy7cL7nGMYMRGgUhNdtzQHtfbBaw-3D-3Dcf5l_mdGnUfD-2Bf3-2FlM5AXZSnhIzXRRxvDxi1mATYAF8x5DphgOsOtW7KGWgXkrKZXyWcayJZXjBRvOXpR89ZxjmUzMMo-2Bhjrh6tEE80X7AnDrXjututRZE1P9-2BH-2FjWV8G8rMF9Vg6oAx8aBTaZsn4gUJ3wifABzoFy7VN4JlpjRHq8xtZO9VuhZ8eBV5VaBxEDz-2BdjD1XvFk2UbIYdwZFiKGL-2BLSpUWv1HRQ3m0pWkIomFHWGXrU14ZBoLaDSBgsuJXSTmCaqvWG6sRbrO-2Bd9-2BNgFMrWyLQmT6f4GRwZMqsbIMTcQjiE96j-2FnmiRWKniLAMmISm-2F7rSmPDKKhTMIkECpLR-2FklNI7TLNg30ei3eX8rdXbN1RZX7i-2Flwmk-2Fh4HYONfK41E0iBlu-2B6jIKFimR4FUoIdBeeOtTi2Hy4jqGuoSBuZFKL-2BMX3FF0M-2F49W4XT0fG0PXeQxGUxAw3TN-2Bek1byOJmD0w0ZhoyzmFXxFRetOqhLxKhA5YaGQYS9Lo-2BSSvMjPzgU72i8feu1xwMTOsiAtQR1oVUYk3aT4Im-2BIx7ZcBtNeDUXzHw0xxgz8-2BO5JjfpFiw7hNYl0zPOXHbXx-2Fe49w86dkvJvEUpq6hmyxaA5o-2Fxrr-2BN0N7Nr664EsEvNVPpY6LlQshVMAZSNwDjf5lBK2ynwj6j-2B6FjOVR6SWob6V49QH-2FFNE4ZdfIobuIfbKkF)."},{title:"News ‚Äî Decentralized Finance Application bZx Attacked Twice in One Week, Around $940,000 Lost | The Block",content:"**What Happened?**\n\nDecentralized finance (DeFi) lending protocol bZx has just been exploited - again.

Key to the manipulation was the use of a \"flash loan\" which allowed the manipulator to carry out the whole process within a single transaction on the Ethereum blockchain. Flash loans are unique as they have no collateralization requirements, therefore the attacker was able to pull off the scheme without any upfront capital.\n\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Fbzximg.jpg)\n\nThe fact that an attacker was able to pull off similar attacks twice does not look good for either bZx or the DeFi ecosystem as a whole. This has been reflected in the \"Total Value Locked\" data for bZx where the USD value of collateral locked in the platform fell from $19.4M to $12.6M yesterday, as we show in the graph below. We think that such an issue is not an existential risk to the DeFi ecosystem on Ethereum but it does show that the ecosystem has serious issues with manipulation and security risk handling where there currently does not exist an operational precedent.

Binance Cloud will overtake the company‚Äôs main exchange to become its biggest source of revenue in five years, co-founder and CEO ‚ÄúCZ‚Äù Zhao Changpeng estimates.\n\n**Why Does It Matter?**\n\nThe original value proposition of crypto assets was their ability to reduce the marginal cost of engaging in finance and creating financial instruments. We can view Binance's efforts to massively reduce the fixed costs involved in launching an exchange as a further expression of that. Cloud computing has been one of the most profitable areas of technology over the last five years due to platforms like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. It remains to be seen whether a crypto-focused cloud vertical could generate similar margins in the long-term.\n\nOne possibility is that Binance's cloud solution is used mainly to provide bespoke exchange offerings in particularly underserved geographies (i.e. Sub-Saharan Africa or the Middle East) or segments of the industry (i.e. prediction markets) which would benefit from a more unbundled exchange ecosystem. The chart below shows data from Gartner of the growth in the cloud computing industry from 2009 to 2022, with the data points for 2019-2022 using Gartner's predictions. Such rapid growth of the cloud computing industry has been the impetus behind many businesses attempting to incorporate cloud computing offerings (such as for software development, for example) to some success, it remains to be seen whether the strategy will work for Binance.\n\n**Disclaimer: Note that Amun launched an ETP in collaboration with Binance ‚Äî the Amun Binance BNB ETP (ABNB).**\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\"100%\" height=\"520\" src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002F20200218graph4.html\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"},{title:f,content:ai}]},slug:"newsletter-issue-42"},{name:pY,date:"2020-02-25T13:00:00.000Z",category:e,tags:[],en:{title:pY,sections:[{title:h,content:"The entire crypto asset market had a difficult week following on from last week's news of FCoin's insolvency and the two Decentralized Finance market manipulation attacks we mentioned in [last week's newsletter.](https:\u002F\u002Furl1861.amun.com\u002Fls\u002Fclick?upn=c7riRqhfexRyaQmWj4xmkWGSLWqR09IfN3TNaFr6JtUgFCLj7Hwg22gU2-2FKAECsYX8iN_mdGnUfD-2Bf3-2FlM5AXZSnhIzXRRxvDxi1mATYAF8x5DphgOsOtW7KGWgXkrKZXyWcayJZXjBRvOXpR89ZxjmUzMMo-2Bhjrh6tEE80X7AnDrXjututRZE1P9-2BH-2FjWV8G8rMFZdcB9PAYEmixC7vN8-2B35EKins9B5MoPhFfx7RyKfRuGceYvtxoLlL2ThjD04UfDAEFTrjrVCRt8s4K-2F01Y8sfx1lxUJ3i6SAHpMBIkWh8YrHVdZQUooGTrC1aUPqk3rXnqV3kWGVFAW0cwuKnlEyrFIGzuM4le89vR9EgrXzxkKqCKlDFUGAdraU1kuLSb3oSU1tzpwc0j1UcAi2FLRqxkfr9lIW-2BH-2FqZFz72gJCAZ1JgqEhv867y-2FmImhYfOiq1Kvg48ZyQbkvEouksYozLpGtgrvcXzimtoAh-2BWMnk4iUbIRqcTQPabp0bGDLzK-2Ff3y-2F50keTxvFSTrdHbkjozEa4RrMFuXUSjkrL6Q8md3sDrTgZr74Rp0di1w-2B26zCX6Kqm1yRNSl0rGWE53oU60eR9IqMNh8ois2m8WhfomcL6QYR5vBHU27MdTHcwhQ6RwKl-2FpM4R1jzc4hiNbqGWzidRc2j6FO-2FOGLAWscwX2CFW-2BK9r8S6z-2Bub3C9NysLQKq0BHmKHthybZy1hS2VZQAM20YEtk8RyGDpWIjF8cRbNFqy-2Bcb1un4YnlOAw7bYZ7gT65HAHWojWyCZ7XWSbXt8U53IxHg3CSg74U9T08Wxkw-3D) The market continued to fall on Monday 24 February coinciding with when global markets tumbled on [heightened fears of the Coronavirus epidemic](https:\u002F\u002Furl1861.amun.com\u002Fls\u002Fclick?upn=c7riRqhfexRyaQmWj4xmkXEp4YVDS9dpBmhtjzWUYoOapNAE96FXkN1f3QEdMybfz-2BZfW8n1R3MuX2C996lUNh0qfKhtJ6A9obq5508W6sJEBMa9PK6zXQdWXfvPlRjNKSOo_mdGnUfD-2Bf3-2FlM5AXZSnhIzXRRxvDxi1mATYAF8x5DphgOsOtW7KGWgXkrKZXyWcayJZXjBRvOXpR89ZxjmUzMMo-2Bhjrh6tEE80X7AnDrXjututRZE1P9-2BH-2FjWV8G8rMFZdcB9PAYEmixC7vN8-2B35EKins9B5MoPhFfx7RyKfRuGceYvtxoLlL2ThjD04UfDAEFTrjrVCRt8s4K-2F01Y8sfx1lxUJ3i6SAHpMBIkWh8YrHVdZQUooGTrC1aUPqk3rXnqV3kWGVFAW0cwuKnlEyrFIGzuM4le89vR9EgrXzxkKqCKlDFUGAdraU1kuLSb3oSU1tzpwc0j1UcAi2FLRqxkfr9lIW-2BH-2FqZFz72gJCAZ1JgqEhv867y-2FmImhYfOiq1Kvg48ZyQbkvEouksYozLpGtgrvcXzimtoAh-2BWMnk4iUbIRqcTQPabp0bGDLzK-2Ff3y-2F50keTxvFSTrdHbkjozEa4RrMFuXUSjkrL6Q8md3sDrTgZr74Rp0di1w-2B26zCX6Kqm1yRNSl0rGWE53oU60eR9IqMNh8ois2m8WhfomcL72pNilQsJhZYZQZwQnhFXkYPCWLjikUSibn0rdN7S7UD9VlR-2Fkf6TVNsv0xBmUVdgpRNLQxtCNb88ynii-2FEi6L4NYBekPMnBvafrRO6LChhEkgv9gl4XlRlviTqhpUOCD-2B5STWHIP-2FbUv9Z7mHJGjUXZbRCYLEq6ntqJ76lRi02MDklxok6Msgd-2FOTe-2FDGar8-3D).

The chart below shows Shopify's gross merchandise volume since Q1 2014, helping demonstrate the rapid growth in the business over the coming years despite potential competition from technology giants like Amazon.\n\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Funnamed-3-.png)\n\nLearn more [here](https:\u002F\u002Furl1861.amun.com\u002Fls\u002Fclick?upn=c7riRqhfexRyaQmWj4xmkT-2Be8-2Bir0-2BKQF-2BY2JZ7o0zro7YomibXw-2Bu4YO7y9Vj8xiKT1mN9gZCIrT044rgGg-2BanUab4xrCSaGNT9yh9Ng7s-3DNgg7_mdGnUfD-2Bf3-2FlM5AXZSnhIzXRRxvDxi1mATYAF8x5DphgOsOtW7KGWgXkrKZXyWcayJZXjBRvOXpR89ZxjmUzMMo-2Bhjrh6tEE80X7AnDrXjututRZE1P9-2BH-2FjWV8G8rMFZdcB9PAYEmixC7vN8-2B35EKins9B5MoPhFfx7RyKfRuGceYvtxoLlL2ThjD04UfDAEFTrjrVCRt8s4K-2F01Y8sfx1lxUJ3i6SAHpMBIkWh8YrHVdZQUooGTrC1aUPqk3rXnqV3kWGVFAW0cwuKnlEyrFIGzuM4le89vR9EgrXzxkKqCKlDFUGAdraU1kuLSb3oSU1tzpwc0j1UcAi2FLRqxkfr9lIW-2BH-2FqZFz72gJCAZ1JgqEhv867y-2FmImhYfOiq1Kvg48ZyQbkvEouksYozLpGtgrvcXzimtoAh-2BWMnk4iUbIRqcTQPabp0bGDLzK-2Ff3y-2F50keTxvFSTrdHbkjozEa4RrMFuXUSjkrL6Q8md3sDrTgZr74Rp0di1w-2B26zCX6Kqm1yRNSl0rGWE53oU60eR9IqMNh8ois2m8WhfomcL5hYOo0nofJVZSZ-2BIawpGU1lIm0zZ-2FMKt4SjpsVvndr0NUHmx2vJcMr8vM5I1nXfzG7RZNRFH-2FVz8DYq6nsTgARuDLTmWBpTkB4d0LzN9Fo2EBkP5bSjJFdkD5-2FPLzoQQs2uaxAyKVksJ6GHL2I8Rs01fYmpG-2BZtyCL0ArrlYOHAb9o-2FBqIMvvEGVuALm4v8lE-3D)."},{title:"News ‚Äî ICO Project Enigma Settles SEC Charges Over $45M Token Sale | CoinDesk",content:"**What Happened?**\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has settled securities law violation charges with Enigma MPC, a blockchain startup that raised $45 million in a 2017 token sale.\n\nThe [regulator announced Wednesday](https:\u002F\u002Furl1861.amun.com\u002Fls\u002Fclick?upn=c7riRqhfexRyaQmWj4xmkV90-2B5OJFq-2FYybb3k-2BioNcAbaqgCN-2F29SLRZPtkMsctXiwm4abA4-2Fim-2BfvoiP60Fog-3D-3Drf3a_mdGnUfD-2Bf3-2FlM5AXZSnhIzXRRxvDxi1mATYAF8x5DphgOsOtW7KGWgXkrKZXyWcayJZXjBRvOXpR89ZxjmUzMMo-2Bhjrh6tEE80X7AnDrXjututRZE1P9-2BH-2FjWV8G8rMFZdcB9PAYEmixC7vN8-2B35EKins9B5MoPhFfx7RyKfRuGceYvtxoLlL2ThjD04UfDAEFTrjrVCRt8s4K-2F01Y8sfx1lxUJ3i6SAHpMBIkWh8YrHVdZQUooGTrC1aUPqk3rXnqV3kWGVFAW0cwuKnlEyrFIGzuM4le89vR9EgrXzxkKqCKlDFUGAdraU1kuLSb3oSU1tzpwc0j1UcAi2FLRqxkfr9lIW-2BH-2FqZFz72gJCAZ1JgqEhv867y-2FmImhYfOiq1Kvg48ZyQbkvEouksYozLpGtgrvcXzimtoAh-2BWMnk4iUbIRqcTQPabp0bGDLzK-2Ff3y-2F50keTxvFSTrdHbkjozEa4RrMFuXUSjkrL6Q8md3sDrTgZr74Rp0di1w-2B26zCX6Kqm1yRNSl0rGWE53oU60eR9IqMNh8ois2m8WhfomcL5aWdHPBsLMk92N5BcfJDLfJ3vXIaYIsy6pHqvCtngCR2A6KyUjm9OIVTG6qrpj0XulQTlqFlXtXdDHs5Ytqym2VbVVPljdPcoEoa4eZmO66DWzPmie0dDZWZAu-2Bcpl0pLHfbJloqlN52ZIgCDp5rpK-2FDb8taZunUftm-2BOu5ULLn6gDuqaZRbGeNJtatwkYsD8-3D) that under the settlement Enigma will refund \"harmed investors\" using a claims process, register its tokens as securities with the SEC, file reports to the agency and pay a further $500,000 as a penalty.

The central bank's decision at the time forced crypto exchanges in the country to either close, relocate to other jurisdictions or shift their business model to crypto-to-crypto and over-the-counter trading.\n\nIn addition, South Korean lawmakers voted Thursday to place tough new requirements on cryptocurrency exchanges, adding legitimacy to the country‚Äôs sprawling crypto economy ‚Äì and potentially triggering a market consolidation down the road.\n\nAs reported by CoinDesk Korea, the legislation ‚Äì an amendment to Korea‚Äôs existing Financial Information Act ‚Äì shores up South Korea‚Äôs anti-money-laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CFT) framework for virtual asset service providers (VASPs).\n\n**Why Does It Matter?**\n\nBoth cases show that lawmakers are willing to interact with the industry in good faith which will undoubtedly help entrepreneurs develop businesses in the industry. Looking at Google search interest for Bitcoin in both countries, India has seen a noticeable spike (70.83%) in search interest this week while South Korea has remained flat in comparison (8.33%).

The ongoing spread of the Coronavirus has begun to extract a real human toil whilst at the same time incurring second-order impacts on various parts of the economy ‚Äî the supply chain, the global energy market, the transport sector, and the hospitality industry. For these reasons it makes sense that both traditional financial assets ‚Äî equities, commodities, bonds ‚Äî as well as the crypto asset market have been hit hard. \n\nSince the start of the year Bitcoin is down around 33%, the S&P500 is down over 26% and oil is down nearly 55%. In this research piece we will help demonstrate how the Bitcoin  market is likely oversold due to the current flight-to-cash environment we are in. This was exacerbated by the large amount of leverage within the system which deleveraged quickly; further falls will likely be buttressed by continuing strong retail demand for Bitcoin.\n\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002F848x347.png)\n\nBitcoin suffered its worst day in years last Thursday (12 March), however, we can use fundamental Bitcoin blockchain data to better understand how the market likely oversold ‚Äî driven by the deleveraging of fund managers and derivative exchanges, as well as miners reaching their short-term cash needs. Bitcoin‚Äôs Network-Value-to-Realized-Value (NVRV) ratio measures the ratio between Bitcoin‚Äôs current price and its estimated average cost-basis.\n\nGiven that investors are seldomly willing to sell an asset at a price lower than that at which they bought it, this ratio rarely stays below 1; in fact, the last time the NVRV ratio was below 1 was at the bottom of the 2019 bear market. As of Monday 16 March, Bitcoin‚Äôs NVRV ratio was around 0.9 but, based on historical data, there is good reason to believe that it is unlikely to remain there for long.\n\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002F6000x4000.png)\n\nOne promising feature of Bitcoin‚Äôs downturn is the fact that it was likely solely driven by institutional investors. The heightened correlation between Bitcoin and the equity market following particular news events (i.e. Fed Rate tightening) suggests that institutional investors experienced a flight-to-cash where all assets perceived as risky were sold off in the last two weeks. Given that Bitcoin has always been a retail-first asset, demand for the asset can still increase even in a prolonged institutional flight-to-cash environment. The chart below looks at Bitcoin‚Äôs blockchain data to highlight periods of time where large amounts of BTC were transferred. We saw clusters of large transactions between last Thursday and Friday driven by whales moving to sell their holdings.\n\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002F839x362.png)\n\nCoinbase‚Äôs trading activity data suggests that there is still retail demand for Bitcoin. According to Coinbase, 76% of Coinbase‚Äôs customers increased their net position in BTC over the last 24 hours of trading. As Coinbase‚Äôs online platform is overwhelmingly retail-focused, this suggests that retail investors are more bullish than bearish despite the recent downward price movement.  While these factors do not necessarily mean that Bitcoin will perform well over the next few weeks they do signal that there has not been an existential shift in investors‚Äô perception of the asset as digital gold and an alternative store of value asset. We believe that, while the next few months are likely to be difficult for all asset classes, the long term implications of the economic crisis ‚Äî such as the continued excessive use of quantitative easing ‚Äî will help improve the value proposition of Bitcoin in the long term. \n\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002F1612x1162.png)\n\nThe top five crypto assets performed as follows: BTC (-36.62%), ETH (-45.06%), XRP (-33.71%), BCH (-37.47%), and LTC (-34.85%).\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\"100%\" height=\"520\" src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002F20200317graph1.html\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\nThe average on-chain transaction volume for the top-five crypto assets is as follows: BTC ($1.89B), ETH ($439M), XRP ($234M), BCH ($108M), and LTC ($28.1M).

For example, the DeFi market was hit heavily on crypto‚Äôs Black Thursday (March 12) and over the weekend an attacker drained a DeFi product, known for enabling decentralized lending, for $25M before returning it after facing legal pressure ‚Äî the first event directly impacted the price of ETH. \n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe class=\"highcharts-iframe\" src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fapp.everviz.com\u002Fembed\u002FQUfYPXcOX\u002F\" style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 450px\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\nAs the crypto market continues to mature it‚Äôll likely continue to look more similar to the existing financial system in certain ways.

The purpose behind this network upgrade is to make the payment platform more regulatory-friendly and to provide initial liquidity to merchants relying on national currencies.\n\nThe pushback, from regulatory authorities and early supporters of the Libra Association that backed out, was over how large of a threat Libra as a single stable coin could be to the sovereignty of fiat currencies (ie, USD, EUR, etc.) if used on a global scale going forward. To alleviate concerns, the Libra Association decided to pivot to a payment platform composed of multiple stablecoins such as the LibraEUR, LibraUSD, LibraGBP, and Libra as another digital currency option among others. \n\n**Why Does It Matter?**\n\nDespite Libra‚Äôs efforts, this upgrade does not make it more likely that the project will launch ‚Äî originally planned to by the end of 2020.

On a fundamental level, the most obvious and consequential change will be that miners will receive less Bitcoin per block they mine. As mentioned above, instead of receiving 12.5 BTC per block mined they will receive 6.25 BTC per block. In previous occasions, this has had little impact on the marginal miner‚Äôs bottom line due to Bitcoin‚Äôs substantial price appreciation over the last 10 years.

In such a case, miners may be willing to operate in unfavourable conditions for a prolonged period of time due to long term positive expectations of future potential income based on historical precedent. In addition, generally low energy prices due to a drop in demand from Coronavirus-related lockdowns is likely to help protect their bottom lines.\n\nThe last week was one of the best in recent memory for the whole crypto asset market with every large-cap crypto noticeably up.

Surprisingly, the day of the Halving (11 May) saw very little volatility but this was likely due to the largely movements during the days before ‚Äî BTC (-4.39%), ETH (-9.86%), XRP (-11.01%), BCH (-5.13%), and LTC (-10.54%). \n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe class=\"highcharts-iframe\" src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fapp.everviz.com\u002Fembed\u002Fda6KwzdWq\u002F\" style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 450px\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\nOn-chain volumes increased for the second week in a row from $2.99B per day to $3.29B ‚Äî BTC ($2.57B), ETH ($457M), XRP ($133M), BCH ($100M), and LTC ($30.4M).\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe class=\"highcharts-iframe\" src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fapp.everviz.com\u002Fembed\u002F0hLrNVZJ9\u002F\" style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 425px\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"},{title:"Webinar ‚Äî State of Crypto Webinar ‚Äî May 7, 2020",content:"Last Thursday, May 7th, we hosted another webinar session ‚Äî breaking down the factors driving the market over the past week and gave a deep dive into the factors influencing the price action of Bitcoin.\n\n In the first part, our senior associates Hansen Wang and Davide Vicini gave an update on the market along with a technical analysis of Bitcoin.

Paul Tudor Jones‚Äô fund, Tudor BVI is buying Bitcoin futures as an inflation hedge due to the current monetary policies implemented by the Federal Reserve ‚Äî creating a total of $3.9 trillion through quantitative easing since last February.\n\n**Why Does It Matter?**\n\nAmid market uncertainty due to the Coronavirus pandemic, there‚Äôs been a significant drop in dollars invested in high-risk assets by large financial institutions. As a new asset class, cryptoassets such as Bitcoin are not immune to similar investment behaviors. But as mentioned by our research team, the digital nature of cryptoassets with a finite and predictable supply ‚Äî uncorrelated with current monetary and fiscal policies and with transportability that does not require social contact ‚Äî have the chance to increasingly become an attractive asset. This is in line with Paul Tudor Jones‚Äô Bitcoin investment thesis. \n\nHowever, it is safe to say that, with the rise of unemployment rates across the world, assuming cryptoasset retail investors lose jobs, along with businesses closing shop due to the COVID19 pandemic, the cryptoasset industry could move more away from being retail-driven towards becoming more institutionalised than ever going forward.\n\nIn fact, 56% of people in the United States unfortunately don't have rainy-day savings that would cover 3 months of expenses. If our hypothesis holds true, this could put significant sell pressure in the price action of cryptoassets, especially if retail investors affected by the economic consequences of this pandemic, have portfolios that have performed poorly and can no longer meet their financial obligations. Although, only time will tell, we will closely observe how the future unfolds on that front. \n\nLearn more [here](https:\u002F\u002Ffr.scribd.com\u002Fdocument\u002F460382154\u002FMay-2020-BVI-Letter-Macro-Outlook)."},{title:"News ‚Äî Trump and Chip Makers Including Intel Seek Semiconductor Self-Sufficiency | The Washington Post",content:"**What Happened?**\n\nThe COVID19 pandemic has likely worsened tensions between the United States and China, which could linger after the virus is contained.

As such, amid market uncertainty, high-net worth families and businesses as they are seeking safer places to store their wealth ‚Äî might find an inherently digital, censorship-resistant and neutral asset such as Bitcoin increasingly start to make sense in their portfolios. \n\nHowever, Bitcoin might not be the first cryptoasset of choice to flee renminbi-denominated assets due to market volatility. USD-pegged stablecoins such as USD Coin (USDC) might end up being just as attractive assets for those seeking to avoid losing large portions of their wealth due to price fluctuations over the short and medium terms. \n\nThe only roadblock, in such a case, would be if crypto exchanges and other liquidity providers prevent China-based investors from opening accounts due to specific clauses in their terms and conditions ‚Äî a phenomenon the 21Shares research team discovered in this [study](https:\u002F\u002Fyoutu.be\u002FGKtWoCZR5Vw).

Suffice it to say, there has been (some may argue for the last forty years) a significant decoupling of the financial economy from the real economy ‚Äî  where on the one hand large businesses can receive cheap loans or sell equity at inflated prices through capital markets and, yet on the other hand, millions of Americans have been forced to deal with pay cuts, furloughs, or unemployment. \n\nWhile the crypto asset industry is not a panacea for such problems, at its core Bitcoin can be viewed as an attempt to build a financial system without the need for large institutions or businesses who have often thwarted the financial wellbeing of individual citizens.

The recent Halving helps demonstrate that the market understands the key role that miners play and that miners themselves can drastically impact the demand-supply dynamics of the Bitcoin market ‚Äî through the amount of mined Bitcoin they sell on the open market and how that changes over time due to Halving events.\n\nWhat is clear is that post-halving, the total amount of hashrate dedicated to mining on Bitcoin has reduced. This is likely due to certain miners having to reduce their operating costs or completely shutting down due to the reduction in their revenues from mining (Bitcoin‚Äôs mining reward fell from 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC), as well as [technical issues](https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002FExcellion\u002Fstatus\u002F1254246495307653121?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1254246495307653121&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fnews%2Fsamson-mow-bitmain-s17-t17-antminer-has-high-failure-rate) with existing mining equipment such as the Antminer S17. There had been the chances that such miners may be able to survive the halving if Bitcoin‚Äôs price appreciated shortly after May 11, but in the absence of such a price appreciation Bitcoin‚Äôs hashrate has dropped by nearly 20% since the start of the month. The chart below shows exactly this.\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe class=\"highcharts-iframe\" src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fapp.everviz.com\u002Fembed\u002F3moaRmDJE\u002F\" style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 420px\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\nMore interestingly, is that the mining market has become increasingly financialized over the last year ‚Äî with an influx of various options for investors to buy exposure to [mining equipment](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.nicehash.com\u002F) or hedge their exposure to mining through [futures contracts](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.coindesk.com\u002Fcrypto-long-short-mining-derivatives-point-to-growing-sophistication). This new era of mining financialization is likely to make it easier for miners to hedge against future Halvings or protect their bottom line against Bitcoin price volatility, whilst also allowing investors to speculate on changes in the mining market.\n\nThe chart below shows a metric that is called the ‚ÄúHashprice‚Äù, it means the estimated amount of Bitcoin one can be expected to earn for a given amount of mining hashrate applied for the SHA256 algorithm used for Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Bitcoin SV. We look at the metric since the start of the year and we take the data from the mining contract provider [Nicehash](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.nicehash.com\u002F). \n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe class=\"highcharts-iframe\" src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fapp.everviz.com\u002Fembed\u002FWF5pRJlzU\u002F\" style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 420px\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\nAs we can see, a few weeks before the halving we saw a large spike in the Hashprice (as measured by Nicehash), the likely reason for this ‚Äî given it was not caused by a Bitcoin appreciation ‚Äî was that mining likely became noticeably less competitive, making it easier for a marginal miner to generate yield. This reduction in competition was likely caused by certain miners exiting the mining industry due to anticipations of Bitcoin‚Äôs Halving as well as in reaction to the halvings of Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV. \n\nWe can expect the Hashprice to increase in the coming weeks slightly as the Bitcoin protocol adjusts again to the reduction in mining competition (Bitcoin adjusts to mining competition every two weeks through what is called a Difficulty adjustment). It‚Äôs essential that any investor or market participant in Bitcoin must pay attention to mining markets, as they act as one of the biggest drivers of selling pressure on the market. The combination of the Halving and the industry‚Äôs financialization is likely to be a driver of volatility in hashrate going forward and this fact has wider implications for the market. \n\nThe entire crypto asset market was down this week, partially driven by speculation [around a 10-year old previously untouched amount of Bitcoin](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.coindesk.com\u002F50-btc-just-moved-for-first-time-since-2009-but-it-doesnt-look-like-satoshi) (50 BTC) which was transferred to two new addresses. The market reacted negatively to the movement due to fears that it could lead to a large and old holder of Bitcoin selling off. Such theories proved to be unsubstantiated but the market has not since recovered and will likely continue to be susceptible to such event-driven volatility as the market adjust to the post-halving regime ‚Äî BTC (-8.66%), ETH (-4.46), XRP (-4.13%), BCH (-6.36%), and BSV (-7.43%). \n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe class=\"highcharts-iframe\" src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fapp.everviz.com\u002Fembed\u002FUTOKe00mL\u002F\" style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 450px\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"},{title:"DisruptNetwork Webinar with Sina Meier (Head of Business Development, Switzerland)",content:"Last week, on Wednesday May 20th from 3:00 PM to 3:45 PM CET, [hosted](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.eventbrite.co.uk\u002Fe\u002Fhow-can-women-easily-enter-in-the-blockchain-industry-online-workshop-tickets-104126860242?aff=esli&utm-source=li&utm-term=listing&utm-campaign=social&utm-medium=discovery&utm-content=attendeeshare) by DisruptNetwork ‚Äî our Director of Business Development (Switzerland), Sina Meier shared her [story](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.linkedin.com\u002Fpulse\u002Fwhy-i-started-working-crypto-how-story-my-career-path-meier-ciwm\u002F) on how she broke into the cryptoasset industry and how it would help to pave the way for getting more women to jump on the train going forward. \n\nWatch the full video [here](https:\u002F\u002Fyoutu.be\u002FALeA1vxSMvg) and read her story [here](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.linkedin.com\u002Fpulse\u002Fwhy-i-started-working-crypto-how-story-my-career-path-meier-ciwm\u002F) (6-minute read)."},{title:"News ‚Äî Early Bitcoin Miner Calls Craig Weight a Fraud Through \"His Own\" Addresses | CoinTelegraph",content:"**What Happened?**\n\nOn May 21st, the infamous and controversially self-pronounced creator of Bitcoin, Craig Wright, submitted for the third time a [list](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.courtlistener.com\u002Frecap\u002Fgov.uscourts.flsd.521536\u002Fgov.uscourts.flsd.521536.512.7.pdf) of Bitcoin addresses and blocks to the Florida court. Wright claims to own 1.1 million BTC that he mined in the early days of Bitcoin, which allegedly belong to a trust called Tulip Trust. This amount of Bitcoin must have been transferred to the Tulip Trust by January 2020 but results of previous investigations have proved him wrong on several occasions. \n\nYesterday, an early miner from 2009 signed a message disputing Craig Wright‚Äôs claims using the private keys of addresses belonging to a list that Craig Wright had claimed were under his ownership. The [message](https:\u002F\u002Fpaste.debian.net\u002Fplain\u002F1148565) accused Wright of being a liar and a fraud for his often-repeated attempts to take credit for the creation of Bitcoin and for the identity of its pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakomoto.\n\n**Why Does It Matter?**\n\nOpenness and unforgeability are quintessential features for the integrity of the Bitcoin blockchain, especially in the midst of controversial investigations such as this one. Without these features it would have been easier for Craig Wright to falsify his claims of ownership of Bitcoin addresses and change their timestamp. \n\nHowever, in such a case, this early Bitcoin miner showed the cryptoasset community one of the most important benefits of Bitcoin as a bearer digital asset ‚Äî one can, to some extent, anonymously prove their ownership of Bitcoin by signing a cryptographic message without revealing their real identity. The openness of the Bitcoin Blockchain lets the community, and most importantly law enforcements in this case, promptly verify the accuracy of the information.\n\nIt‚Äôs been an 11-year run since people, whether they be law enforcement or members of Bitcoin community, have tried to unveil the real identity of Satoshi Nakomoto. But what occurred yesterday is a testament to the fact that we are still navigating in uncharted waters regarding the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto.

They predict banks will resort to fee income increases and cost cutting in order to maintain their bottom lines. In other words, charging fees on checking and investment accounts, laying off some of their employees, or closing branches to offset pressures on their P&L. On a similar note, the Financial Times [reported](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.ft.com\u002Fcontent\u002Ff467f3c1-886e-4543-b35e-52058651d67c?emailId=5ecc2a2d90133a0004799681&segmentId=ce31c7f5-c2de-09db-abdc-f2fd624da608) the biggest restructuring by HBSC involving the potential sale of its US business and retail network in France.\n\n**Why Does It Matter?**\n\nIn the case of charging fees on checking and investment accounts ‚Äî this means that retail and institutional investors will earn negative interest rates, losing their cash holdings in the bank. Rising uncertainty in the job market due to the COVID-19‚Äôs economic consequences, has turned people into savers to protect themselves against rainy days through emergency funds. Losing cash holdings in traditional bank accounts would lead investors seeking for better places to store their cash, namely positive interest-bearing accounts. \n\nSuch a scenario will be important to watch especially for the cryptoasset industry, as there are services available such as [USDC Rewards](https:\u002F\u002Fblog.coinbase.com\u002Fstart-earning-crypto-rewards-on-coinbase-today-d54d12e9aac) launched by Coinbase that lets investors earn interest, as high as 1.25% APY, on their USDC holdings. It is not implausible that we could witness capital flow to USD-pegged stablecoins from investors looking to build emergency funds without losing a portion of their wealth through fees charged by traditional banks. A safe and better user experience from service providers will be a must to ensure that in the case of a hack investors have insurance on their stablecoins.

Given current market uncertainty driven by the Coronavirus pandemic, Goldman Sachs held a bearish opinion on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies overall. As such, the investment bank did not consider cryptoassets as a real asset class nor as a suitable investment for their clients.

On May 2, 2018 when the article was published by Nathaniel Popper, the price of Bitcoin was oscillating around $9,000. In the 4th quarter of the same year, the overall crypto asset industry experienced a market correction over the same time frame as the US equity market correction. While the S&P 500 Index nosedived by 17.5% from late September to December 2018, the price of Bitcoin lost almost half its value, at that time, dropping from $6,621 to $3,797. \n\nAlthough the exact starting date of when Goldman Sachs‚Äô Bitcoin trading began was not specified in the article, the general crypto market outlook in 2018 indicates their likely portfolio performance for their clients that year. For example, if Goldman Sachs started Bitcoin trading in June 2018, the investment bank would have lost exactly half of its Bitcoin holdings denominated in USD by late December 2018. \n\nDue to a lack of strong understanding of the [fundamentals](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=0Ck3gAAgQbI) and benefits of Bitcoin, the 21Shares Research team presumes that this has led Goldman Sachs to since cease trading Bitcoin.

However, as you can see in this above slide, the investment bank alluded to Bitcoin being a security nevertheless. On a final note, Rana Yared, one of the executives who used to oversee the creation of the Bitcoin trading operation at Goldman Sachs, confessed to the New York Times that she was not a true believer in Bitcoin and this likely influenced the company-wide view on cryptoassets as a whole. \n\nLearn more [here](https:\u002F\u002Fresources.goldman.com\u002Fcontent\u002Fdam\u002Fpwm\u002Fdirect-links\u002Fisg-calls\u002Fclient_call_materials_27May20.pdf?sa=n&rd=n)."},{title:qm,content:"**What Happened?**\n\nThe consequences of the Coronavirus pandemic have started to reflect on consumers and businesses behaviours and future practices.

In the absence of any ETP or ETF option for investors to get exposure to Bitcoin, an alternative but inferior product by Grayscale Investments has come to prominence within the US. However, as we will explain today, investors are getting ripped off due to issues with its structure and a lack of understanding from those who have bought it. Retail investors who buy Bitcoin or Ether through Grayscale's investment trusts are paying a lot more to get exposure to the assets compared to what they would be paying if they had access to ETPs such as ours.\n\nThe two products in question are the [Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC](https:\u002F\u002Fgrayscale.co\u002Fbitcoin-trust\u002F)) and the [Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE)](https:\u002F\u002Fgrayscale.co\u002Fethereum-trust\u002F) which, between them, have accrued around $3.85B in AUM. It‚Äôs important to note that neither product is an ETF nor an ETP but instead a private, open-ended trust.\n\nInstitutional and accredited investors are able to create new shares of the product in two ways. Firstly, at the defined Net Asset Value (NAV) with a $50,000 minimum investment ‚Äî during a periodic private placement round ‚Äî which is used to buy Bitcoin, if the creation happens, with US dollars. While the second way lets investors create new shares in-kind at NAV using an investor's existing Bitcoin holdings. These shares are then ‚Äò[locked](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.globenewswire.com\u002Fnews-release\u002F2020\u002F01\u002F21\u002F1973013\u002F0\u002Fen\u002FGrayscale-Bitcoin-Trust-Becomes-SEC-Reporting-Company.html)‚Äô with the investor for typically 1 year before they are able to sell their shares on OTC markets. This time period has recently been reduced to six months for Grayscale‚Äôs Bitcoin Trust following the news that it had become an [SEC](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.coindesk.com\u002Fgrayscales-bitcoin-trust-is-now-open-to-more-investors-as-sec-reporting-company) reporting company.

The source of the issue with Grayscale‚Äôs products, when compared to ETPs or ETFs, is the lack of the create\u002Fredeem functionality. As many will know with our exchange traded products, we are able to keep the price of the 21Shares Bitcoin ETP (ABTC) close to its NAV thanks to the presence of our independent market makers (or authorized participants) [Flow Traders](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.flowtraders.com\u002F) and [Jane Stree](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.janestreet.com\u002F)t who create and redeem ETP shares if they are at a premium or discount to NAV. \n\nGrayscale‚Äôs investment trust cannot be redeemed and therefore pure arbitrage is not possible on them. This is what has led to, at times, huge premiums on both GBTC and ETHE which are paid by retail investors who cannot create shares at NAV and can only buy on the open market.\n\nThe premiums for GBTC have reached as high as 43.21% historically with a mean of 23.75% and the premium for ETHE has reached as high as 2,022.19% with a mean of 247.61% ‚Äî using data from June 20, 2019 to yesterday.

Rather the premium is simply a function of the lack of redemption mechanism and the poor education about it among the retail investors who likely make up a great deal of demand for the product on secondary markets. \n\nGiven the premium of these products, it is unlikely that savvy or institutional investors are buying these products on the secondary market. Rather, it is likely the case that retail investors are buying the products in order to get exposure to Bitcoin through their brokerage accounts or 401Ks and the institutional and accredited investors that create GBTC are able to resell at large markups.\n\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Fgbtc_1.png)\n\nAs we can see, creations of Grayscale‚Äôs products are mostly driven by institutional investors according to Grayscale. Given this fact, it‚Äôs likely that some of the inflows into Grayscale‚Äôs products are both a view on the premium ‚Äî as investors can then sell at a premium on OTC markets after their lockup ‚Äî and a way to benefit from some of the [tax advantages](https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002FFelipether\u002Fstatus\u002F1269651325370892288), given that the products can be held in IRAs and 401ks.\n\nHowever, the vast majority of inflows into Grayscale‚Äôs products are in-kind which means that existing Bitcoin holders are creating shares using their own holdings to take advantage of the premium and tax advantages. Only between 20-30% of inflows are cash-based, which are then used to buy cryptoassets such as Bitcoin from the market. \n\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Fgbtc_2.png)\n\nWhile Grayscale‚Äôs products do seem to be a driver of retail interest in Bitcoin and other assets, the structure allows institutional investors to lock-up their existing holdings and see tax benefits when they then sell at a premium. While this may be good for investors who can benefit from trading the premium, retail investors are losing out and it is obvious that such a situation is less than ideal. Key to fixing such issues is the availability of exchange-traded products for cryptoassets in the United States with a create\u002Fredeem functionality ‚Äî the likes of which are available to investors across Europe currently with 21Shares. \n\nWe can view shares in Grayscale‚Äôs Bitcoin product, for an institutional investor, as a call option on a Bitcoin ETP or ETF not being approved in the United States. As such, growth in these products can be quite decoupled from the actual fundamental institutional interest in Bitcoin. Institutional investors obviously are taking a view on the long term existence of the premium rather than necessarily on the long term price of Bitcoin. \n\nThe market had a noticeably quiet week, following the month of May which saw an extended period of volatility following the Halving, as the crypto asset market continue to decouple from wider capital markets once again ‚Äî BTC (2.70%), ETH (3.70%), XRP (0.691%), BCH (1.60%), and BSV (-2.03%).\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe class=\"highcharts-iframe\" src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fapp.everviz.com\u002Fembed\u002FCwp0e4W0e\" style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 500px\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"},{title:"The Adoption Life Cycle of Bitcoin",content:"For those of you who have not had a chance to listen to our researcher Eliezer Ndinga‚Äôs breakdown of Bitcoin‚Äôs adoption lifecycle, have a [listen here](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=GKtWoCZR5Vw)!"},{title:"News ‚Äî 66% of Coinbase Users Would Delete Their Account | Bitcoin.com ",content:"**What Happened?**\n\nLast week, the renowned crypto exchange, Coinbase, shook up the community as The Block [reported](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.theblockcrypto.com\u002Fpost\u002F67551\u002Fcoinbase-irs-dea-analytics-neutrino) that the exchange would sell its Blockchain Analytics software to US government agencies ‚Äî the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

Although these events have at least a[ 99.73%](https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002F68%E2%80%9395%E2%80%9399.7_rule) probability of not occurring, when they take place, they have historically spread panic across markets as the value of portfolios tend to move more than 3 standard deviations from the asset's average historical return. Left tail events have a devastating impact on portfolio returns as they move more than negative 3 standard deviations from the mean. In other words, they initiate large losses.  \n\nIn a nutshell, this tail-risk aversion indicator compares the left tails of two metrics to measure investors‚Äô risk aversion. \n\n* The risk-neutral density of an equity price. This metric estimates price expectations and risk attitudes of investors. In other words, it measures the future equity returns based on daily call and put options traded on the EURO STOXX 50, adjusted to the level of investors‚Äô risk aversion. \n* Physical density represents investors‚Äô best judgment about the probabilities of future equity prices. \n\nWhen the index is above 1, investors are more fearful and will tend to pay higher premiums on options contracts than historically recorded to insure against adverse outcomes. As such, risk-neutral density will overstate the potential physical density, in other words, investors‚Äô best judgments about the probabilities of future equity prices being affected by negative tail events.\n\nConversely, an index between 0 and 1 likely shows a higher appetite for risk and better investors‚Äô judgments. Currently, the EURO STOXX 50 tail risk aversion indicator stands at 0.2 indicating greater confidence for potential equity returns and more appetite for riskier assets such as Bitcoin.\n\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Fnewsletter_2.png)\n\nWhile the EURO STOXX 50 index is -14.2% since its pre-COVID-19 level in early March 2020, Bitcoin has risen by 10.1% over the same time frame.

According to a survey conducted by Fidelity Investments, in Europe and the United States, 45% of respondents are invested in cryptoassets. In fact, there‚Äôs been an outflow of money from private banks going to Coinbase accounts and to more traditional investment vehicles such as the 21Shares Bitcoin ETP, ABTC.\n\nNonetheless, with a potential second wave on the horizon, drastic lockdown measures as the ones earlier this year could hurt European investors‚Äô confidence.

The main indicators mentioned in the report were declining volatility, growth in on-chain addresses, investor flows, and futures open interest. The author of the report, Mike McGlone, [tweeted](https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002Fmikemcglone11\u002Fstatus\u002F1278702784184045569) that ‚ÄúBitcoin means financial freedom‚Äù and suggested that Bitcoin is increasingly becoming like gold given the current macroeconomic environment.\n\n**Why Does It Matter?**\n\nWith a limited supply of 21 million, there will be a cap on the Bitcoin available for sale to the total addressable market of more than 7 billion individuals. It is [estimated](https:\u002F\u002Fkraken.docsend.com\u002Fview\u002Fqgmyea2fxeadyk2r) that between 1.5 to 6 million Bitcoins are either lost, stolen, or inaccessible as people may have lost their private keys and in other cases, unfortunately, some Bitcoin holders passed away. Additionally, there are Bitcoins kept by miners and long-term investors who will not sell in the near future.\\\n\\\nAs reported by Bloomberg intelligence, Bitcoin is winning in one of the most quintessential categories, demand. The number of on-chain addresses has breached last year‚Äôs level, for example. Using historical data from Coinmetrics, when the address count on the Bitcoin blockchain exceeded its latest high, the price of Bitcoin recovered from the depth of the bear market in late 2018. As you can see in the chart below, the address count has recently surpassed the highest count since February 2018 of 856 million addresses.\\\n\\\nOn the final note, Bitcoin bottomed to the lowest volatility level ever compared to crude oil which indicates Bitcoin‚Äôs progression into the mainstream and the continuing organic demand for an equivalent of gold in a social-distancing-induced environment.

Over longer time frames, such as since 2017, Bitcoin has drastically outperformed Big Tech stocks but an influx of U.S. Federal Reserve asset purchases this has been the driver behind a noticeable appreciation in the value of all U.S. equities and Big Tech especially. Bitcoin has not been directly affected positively by such policies. Despite this fact, Bitcoin‚Äôs performance is still superior to all of the Big Tech stocks aside from AMZN which has also benefited from a large surge in e-commerce demand due to global lockdowns. \n\nWhile for some investors Big Tech stocks may still be considered hallmark risk-on assets, they are a staple in many active and passive portfolios despite their volatility. Given that Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility is currently at a similar level this may either suggest one of two things: (1) that Bitcoin has undergone a paradigm shift towards reduced volatility; or (2) similar Bitcoin-Big Tech volatility levels will be short-lived and volatility will either decrease in Big Tech or increase for Bitcoin.\n\nThe crypto asset market was flat-to-negative over the last week with the exception of XRP which saw an early-week 10% rise: BTC (-0.17%), ETH (0.13%), XRP (7.37%), BCH (-2.49%), and BSV (-2.25%).\n\n\u003Ciframe class=\"highcharts-iframe\" src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fapp.everviz.com\u002Fembed\u002FRpN0C_yms\u002F\" title=\"Chart: Email20200714Graph1\" style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 500px\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E"},{title:"News ‚Äî Annual Economic Report | Bank for International Settlements",content:"**What Happened?**\n\nThe Bank for International Settlements (BIS) published its bi-annual economic report, diving into the global economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. One of the unconventional patterns discovered by BIS is how the current health crisis has strengthened the US dollar hegemony. This isn‚Äôt a new trend, for example, according to the Bank for International Settlements, US dollar liabilities of non-US financial institutions grew from about $3.5 trillion in 2000 to around $10.3 trillion by the end of 2019.\n\n\\\n**Why Does It Matter?**\n\nThe Federal Reserve has had to act in its time-honored role of lender of last resort by supplying needed liquidity in offshore US dollar borrowing, notably via FX swaps, to ease dollar funding shortages. In fact, many non-US financial institutions and firms outside the United States cannot raise USD-denominated funds directly in US money markets, as such, they have relied on FX swaps.\\\n\\\nAdditionally, the Fed reactivated many currency [swap lines](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.investopedia.com\u002Fgovernment-stimulus-efforts-to-fight-the-covid-19-crisis-4799723#citation-244) that had expired since the Great Financial Crisis, for 14 central banks from both advanced and emerging economies, utilized in particular by the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank. This allowed central banks to borrow US dollars directly from the Fed using their holdings of US Treasuries as collateral. It is safe to say, so far, this health crisis has amplified the dominance of the US dollar as the world‚Äôs dominant currency.\\\n\\\nWhile inflation has always been a concern when it comes to quantitative easing measures implemented by central banks, it is important to recognize the reliance of USD-denominated assets by financial institutions outside of the United States. As such the FX swaps metric is a quintessential indicator for USD demand from non-US banks. This pattern is important to note as consequences of containment measures such as reductions in consumer demand will likely make the path to inflation unlikely in the near term. Nonetheless asset price inflation is undeniably reflected in financial markets with the current market rally amid surging new coronavirus cases, especially in some US states.\n\n![](\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Fimage20200908.jpg)\n\nLearn more [here](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.bis.org\u002Fpubl\u002Farpdf\u002Far2020e.pdf)."},{title:"News ‚Äî Virus Boosts Digital Payments in India Where Cash Ban Failed | Bloomberg",content:"**What Happened?**\n\nThe value of transactions on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), a platform created by National Payments Corporation of India ‚Äî allowing inter-bank transfers, reached an all-time high last month as people increasingly fear handling banknotes amid the pandemic. It can be argued that the COVID-19 pandemic has done more in terms of promoting the adoption of mobile-first payment methods than the banknote demonetisation seen in India over the last four years.\n\n\n**Why Does It Matter?**\n\nIn times of crisis, the need for a sense of urgency has historically led to a fundamental change in people‚Äôs behaviour. As public concerns about viral transmission from cash have risen, this health crisis has accelerated the trend towards the use of digital payments such as contactless payments. Companies in the private sector such as CashApp played an important role in facilitating direct transfers to households and firms as part of the $2 trillion Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.\n\nIn a similar vein, a quite different picture is starting to emerge as investors seek a digital version of gold, especially in light of the biggest gold-counterfeiting scandal in modern history.

Prior to the disbursement of the funds, member states in the EU will prepare national recovery and resilience plans for the years 2021-2023.

A V-shaped recovery seems out of reach as higher precautionary savings to build buffers and repay the debt will continue to dampen expenditures on the consumer demand side partly due to lingering worries of infection. \n\nThis will put further pressure on both monetary and fiscal policy buffers especially in scenarios where insolvencies and capital misallocation prevail. Additionally, heightened uncertainty could lead to a somewhat difficult exercise for governments of ascertaining insolvent but viable firms as pre-existing business models might no longer be defensible over the long run. Early discoveries of capital misallocation by governments have started to emerge with PPP fraud charges in the US or fraudulent filings by companies to benefit from the furlough scheme in France.\n\nIt is safe to say that this new recovery package approved by the EU council could lead to a debt overhang in various economies such as Italy and Spain ‚Äî the hardest-hit countries by this public health crisis, especially when insolvencies will start to kick in.

In the midst of a rise in personal bitcoin investments from its senior employees and advisors, the firm launched a spinoff to satisfy the needs of its clients in partnership with New York Digital Investment Group (NYDIG) acting as a custodian and granting the asset manager the possibility to hold and convert cryptoassets.\n\n\n**Why Does It Matter?**\nThe rationale behind the spinoff is the fact that internally, in the words of co-founder Robert Gutmann, Stone Ridge believes in the long term benefits and growth of an open-source monetary system in assets like Bitcoin. The current health crisis has proved to become a Schelling point for one of its most valuable characteristics, the fact that Bitcoin is uncorrelated with traditional assets; for example, since January 1st, 2020, Bitcoin is up 67.50% while S&P 500 is up 6.94%.\n\nAlthough in times of uncertainty, correlations between all assets will always spike, in the medium to long term, it is well documented that Bitcoin stands out. The NYDIG‚Äôs lead investor even advises financial institutions to hedge their portfolio with Bitcoin and allocate between 100 and 500 basis points of their assets under management, amid unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus happening across the world.\n\nOn the final note, at 21Shares, we anticipate Bitcoin‚Äôs institutionalization to continue especially as the effects of tighter restrictions and lockdowns across the world, alongside rising caseloads, result in higher rates of bankruptcies and business closures.

Cryptoasset markets have bucked that trend with Bitcoin displaying tremendous strength over the last few weeks driven by several factors that have strengthened the market‚Äôs resolve for long-term Bitcoin demand.\\\n\\\nWe can generally separate the demand for Bitcoin into two different categories ‚Äî investment-driven and fundamental demand. Investment demand encompasses demand for Bitcoin from users who expect its price to appreciate over the long run and aim to actively trade the asset to make money from its volatility. Fundamental demand encompasses demand for Bitcoin from users who aim to use it for its strength as censorship-resistant money; to transfer value to other parties when one would be prevented from doing otherwise.\\\n\\\nOver the last week, there have been several large examples of both forms of demand for Bitcoin. Reading [Microstrategy‚Äôs](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.microstrategy.com\u002Fen\u002Fbitcoin) or [Square‚Äôs](https:\u002F\u002Fsquareup.com\u002Fus\u002Fen\u002Fpress\u002F2020-bitcoin-investment) memos for why they decided to invest in Bitcoin are all examples of investment-driven demand for the asset. In contrast, the heavy use of Bitcoin over the last few weeks in Nigeria to facilitate the funding of the [\\#EndSARS](https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FEnd_SARS) movement, the [anti-police brutality protests](https:\u002F\u002Fqz.com\u002Fafrica\u002F1922466\u002Fhow-bitcoin-powered-nigerias-endsars-protests\u002F) in Nigeria, is an example of fundamental demand. Here Bitcoin was an extremely useful way for tech-savvy supporters of the leading #EndSARS organization, [the Feminist Coalition](https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002Ffeminist_co), in Nigeria, for the worldwide Nigerian diaspora alongside a variety of other communities in response to government-led restrictions of funding for such protests. The chart below shows the growth in the daily bitcoin balance received by the Feminist Coalition during the early days of the protests.\n\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.mcauto-images-production.sendgrid.net\u002F3b7436794fe7d912\u002Fafd5b58e-fbc8-4d03-ae2e-e747c00211ea\u002F1226x776.png)\n\nAdvocates of Bitcoin often cite such examples of Bitcoin‚Äôs use as a censorship-resistant payment rail as it does represent its fundamental use case, but often news stories of investment demand often crowd out fundamental and oftentimes vital demand use. It‚Äôs crucial to understand, however, that the investment demand for Bitcoin is predicated on its continued use as a censorship-resistance form of money.\\\n\\\nThe fact that Bitcoin can be used to avoid unjust financial oppression during uncertain times or can help individuals avoid the [worst of hyperinflation](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.coindesk.com\u002Fhow-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-money-printer) also helps build the value of Bitcoin as a long term alternative to Gold and a Store of Value 2.0. Given this fact, it‚Äôs important that resources and services are dedicated to understanding and developing the fundamental demand of Bitcoin where necessary if the asset is to continue to develop. The early signs are promising and we believe that Bitcoin will continue to excel as a Plan B for the global economy. The increasing adoption of its fundamental use cases as well as the strength of its investment demand in the face of a global pandemic are testaments to that fact.\n\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.mcauto-images-production.sendgrid.net\u002F3b7436794fe7d912\u002F106bcf21-85c3-4c42-975e-ee0faaa8c385\u002F1200x600.png)"},{title:w,content:"The performance of the top five cryptoassets was as follows ‚Äî BTC (9.65%), ETH (6.82%), XRP (2.08%), BCH (8.41%), and BNB (7.73%).

This crypto integration into Venmo means market participants will have the possibility to invest and transfer Bitcoins to their entourage, which unequivocally fosters a sticky network effect and as a result, significantly boosts crypto adoption.

You can find the original email here as well as the whitepaper.\n\n\n**Why Does It Matter?**\nThe release of the bitcoin whitepaper came approximately six weeks after the Great Financial Crisis (GFC) reached its pinnacle with the collapse of the investment bank, Leman Brothers, which filed for bankruptcy on September 15. In hindsight, it is hard to tell if the launch of Bitcoin was simply a coincidence or a concrete example of marketing prowess on the part of Satoshi Nakamoto due to the fact that the BitcoinTalk account of the anonymous character(s) has been inactive since December 13, 2010. But the timing couldn‚Äôt have been better, although Bitcoin was ignored for a year by mainstream media following the launch of the whitepaper.\n\nBitcoin not only offered a solution to prevent double-spending within an internet-based currency ‚Äî a long-time and bedeviling flaw in previous digital cash systems, and an unsolved problem in Computer Science ‚Äî but it also represented a minimum viable product for a new and potentially better financial system free from a central authority.\n\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.mcauto-images-production.sendgrid.net\u002F3b7436794fe7d912\u002F4704065c-e677-48c3-883a-4e35b9a7505b\u002F1354x830.png)\n\n12 years later, no one has discovered the real identity of Satoshi Nakamoto, not even intelligence and security services such as the FBI or the CIA. But Satoshi left behind an asset akin to a scarce precious metal like gold, which now has a market value of more than $235 billion. In the midst of this health crisis and in an environment of zero to negative interest rates, Bitcoin has stood out as the best performing asset this year and over the last decade, with a global endorsement from corporations and professional investors as a hedge against inflation with risk-on-like returns.

Since the launch of our first crypto basket on the SIX Swiss Exchange in November 2018, we have listed a total of 11 different crypto ETPs in four different currencies on five different regulated exchanges in Europe, including the German stock exchange Xetra and the official market of the Vienna Stock Exchange.‚Äù ‚Äì Hany Rashwan, CEO of 21Shares AG.\n\n\\\nOur Research Associates, Lanre Ige and Eli√©zer Ndinga featured in Extra ETF diving into the rising adoption of Bitcoin institutional-grade products at the expense of Gold ETFs.

Ethereum 2.0 is different from the current Ethereum network in two ways: Proof of Stake and Sharding.\n\n* Proof of Stake: Ethereum runs on a consensus mechanism called Proof of Work (PoW) which uses computing power and electricity for miners to build and approve blocks on the blockchain. In contrast, Proof of Stake (PoS) is an upgrade which will improve scalability and sustainability. Instead of using physical mining which expends electricity, PoS users are stakers that deposit 32 Ether and then are chosen to process transactions and validate blocks in proportion to the size of their deposits. This can lead to scalability improvements and requires much less electricity. Phase 0 essentially runs a parallel blockchain, called Beacon chain for proof-of-stake mining efforts alongside the current proof-of-work-enabled Ethereum blockchain.\n* Sharding: Sharding is a scalability effort that seeks to improve the ability of the Ethereum blockchain to handle a greater number of transactions. Sharding is a process through which the Ethereum blockchain is ‚Äúsplit‚Äù into many different sub-nodes or sub-blockchains. This makes it easier for different blocks of transactions to be processed at the same time rather than sequentially. Ethereum 2.0 Sharding can be understood as a multilane approach for a blockchain as opposed to a single lane approach, as for Ethereum 1.0, Bitcoin, and others.\n\nAt 21Shares, we believe that Ethereum will continue to present one of the most lucrative investment opportunities over the next decade as it continues to act as a settlement and issuance layer for vast swathes of existing capital markets infrastructure.\n\nLearn more [here](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.coindesk.com\u002Feth-2-0-deposit-contract-secures-enough-funds-to-launch)."},{title:f,content:j}]},slug:"newsletter-issue-83"},{name:qM,date:"2020-12-01T13:30:00.000Z",category:e,tags:[],en:{title:qM,sections:[{title:"Market Outlook ‚Äî Bitcoin Reaches All-Time-Highs, Bitcoin is Winning the COVID-19 Monetary Revolution, and More",content:"Over the last week Bitcoin reached [all-time-highs](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.bloomberg.com\u002Fnews\u002Farticles\u002F2020-11-30\u002Fbitcoin-jumps-to-record-as-advocates-say-this-time-is-different#:~:text=Bitcoin%20(BTC)%20Price%20Hits%20All,%2419%2C511%3B%20Bulls%20Cheer%20Surge%20%2D%20Bloomberg), passing the levels last seen in December 2017 on exchanges like [Bitstamp](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.coindesk.com\u002Fbitcoin-price-index-all-time-highs) and [Coinbase](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.coindesk.com\u002Fbitcoin-price-index-all-time-highs) and according to data aggregators like [Bloomberg](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.bloomberg.com\u002Fnews\u002Farticles\u002F2020-11-30\u002Fbitcoin-jumps-to-record-as-advocates-say-this-time-is-different#:~:text=Bitcoin%20(BTC)%20Price%20Hits%20All,%2419%2C511%3B%20Bulls%20Cheer%20Surge%20%2D%20Bloomberg) and [CoinGecko](https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002Fcoingecko\u002Fstatus\u002F1333427238302228481).\n\n\u003Ciframe class=\"highcharts-iframe\" src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fapp.everviz.com\u002Fembed\u002FgW50ptbdj\u002F\" title=\"Chart: Email20201208Graph3\" style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 500px\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\n\nBitcoin reaching all-time-highs was matched by some of the largest OTC desks within the space [reporting record volumes](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.theblockcrypto.com\u002Fpost\u002F86020\u002Fcrypto-otc-trading-bitcoin-record-volume) and competing assets, such as Gold, seeing some of their [large weekly product outflows](https:\u002F\u002Fnews.bitcoin.com\u002Fgold-sees-largest-weekly-outflow-ever-metal-prices-spiral-lower-analysts-expect-flows-into-bitcoin\u002F) on paper.

To put this into perspective, USDC, the most regulated and audited USD-pegged stablecoins in the market, has [crossed](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.circle.com\u002Fen\u002Fusdc) the $4 billion market in circulation in the span of two years, while [trillions](https:\u002F\u002Fwww3.weforum.org\u002Fdocs\u002FWEF_Cryptocurrency_Uses_Cases_2020.pdf) of dollars of transactions have been settled on the Bitcoin network.\\\n\\\nThis crypto-infrastructure integration is a major milestone in the adoption cycle of Bitcoin alongside stablecoins ‚Äî opening the possibility of putting public blockchains in the same pedestal as other payment networks such as Fedwire, CHIPS, and SWIFT. In fact, in the document, the regulator affirmed that public blockchains are significantly more resilient than current payment networks thanks to their decentralized nature. Their decentralized nature removes the problem of a single point of failure in downtimes and enables financial activities to keep running as other nodes will verify and validate transactions.\\\n\\\nWhile this is great news, on the regulatory front in the US, there is another hasty pending law under the Trump administration [released](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.federalregister.gov\u002Fdocuments\u002F2020\u002F12\u002F23\u002F2020-28437\u002Frequirements-for-certain-transactions-involving-convertible-virtual-currency-or-digital-assets) as the ‚ÄúNotice of Proposed Rulemaking on Requirements for Certain Transactions Involving Convertible Virtual Currency or Digital Assets (the ‚ÄúProposal‚Äù)‚Äù. This Proposal would effectively allow the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) to expand reporting and Know Your Customer (‚ÄúKYC‚Äù) type obligations to parties who are not the customers of service providers such as crypto payment services and exchanges.\n\nThis proposal has been broadly contested and commented on by the crypto community, including the likes of the renowned VC firm a16z, as well as Twitter and Square‚Äôs CEO Jack Dorsey. While the comment period is shorter than traditionally 60 days, it is important to note that the current administration will end on January 20th which will bring with it a totally new approach to cryptoasset regulation.\n\nLearn more [here](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.occ.gov\u002Fnews-issuances\u002Fnews-releases\u002F2021\u002Fnr-occ-2021-2.html)."},{title:f,content:j}]},slug:"newsletter-issue-89"},{name:qS,date:"2021-01-12T14:05:00.000Z",category:e,tags:[],en:{title:qS,sections:[{title:h,content:qT},{title:w,content:qT},{title:_,content:"The performance of our line of ETPs over the last 30 days is as follows: ABTC (64.7%), AETH (63.4%), ABCH (52.7%), AXRP (-46%), ABNB (34.1%), AXTZ (13.5%), HODL (51.9%), ABBA (63.6%), KEYS (58.5%), and SBTC (-47%).\n\nLearn more about our products [here](https:\u002F\u002F21shares.com\u002Fproduct).\n\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.mcauto-images-production.sendgrid.net\u002F3b7436794fe7d912\u002F300570b6-39bf-44f3-a63a-28e35b8c6666\u002F1200x600.png)"},{title:y,content:"Our Research Associate, Eli√©zer Ndinga featured in Coin24, where he gave his perspective on the patterns and implications for the crypto industry in 2020 alongside his expectations for 2021.

In midst of confusion and an alarming amount of misinformation, the majority (~53%) of the market participants selling their Bitcoin were new entrants that bought the cryptoasset over the last 3 months. Preventing double-spending is a quintessential feature of Bitcoin due to the fact that such an exploit could threaten the scarcity of the asset. In other words, spending as many bitcoins as one would want as such, more bitcoins than one initially had.\n\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.mcauto-images-production.sendgrid.net\u002F3b7436794fe7d912\u002F1f9b6469-91f1-4870-bd05-ec2aa61a59ec\u002F1600x900.png)\n\nWhy Does It Matter?\n\nTo respond to the rumours, **no double spend happened**. A market participant simply tried to speed up the time of her unconfirmed transaction (ie, not added in the blockchain yet) by increasing significantly the fee of her transaction after a day of waiting, as her first transaction ‚Äî worth approximately $25 ‚Äî including a fee that was too small to be accepted by miners. As miners are incentivized to win the block reward of 6.25 BTC in addition to the collected transaction fees within the block, they‚Äôll prioritize the transactions with the highest fees. Therefore, it‚Äôs a common practice to increase the fee of an unconfirmed transaction to speed up the confirmation process.\\\n\\\nIn addition, in decentralized networks, a chain split is a common occurrence as bitcoin transactions are fundamentally not final but probabilistic up until a certain point ‚Äî which is the rationale behind the rule of thumb of waiting for an hour to make sure a transaction is confirmed. This is a rule that is applied by crypto exchanges such as Coinbase for example. In other instances, the confirmation time could be even greater as the amount transferred exceeds the hundreds-of-thousands and the million-dollar mark (an hour is 6 blocks of transactions, as one block gets added every 10 minutes approximately to determine the winning chain with the highest amount of computer capacity\u002Fdifficulty).\\\n\\\nThe creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto [delved into](https:\u002F\u002Fsatoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org\u002Fquotes\u002Ftransactions\u002F?order=desc) this matter in the Cryptography Mailing List on November 10, 2008: *\"Instant non-*reputability *is not a feature, but it's still much faster than existing systems. Paper cheques can bounce up to a week or two later. Credit card transactions can be contested up to 60 to 180 days later. Bitcoin transactions can be sufficiently irreversible in an hour or two.‚Äù*\\\n\\\nHowever, within an hour of waiting, there‚Äôs a rare possibility that two miners win the same mining competition (ie, concurrently add their respective block to the blockchain at the same time). This is exactly what happened in the Bitcoin network, as both mining pools ‚Äî SlushPool and F2Pool found block 666833 at the same time. The tie was broken after Binance‚Äôs mining pool found block 666834 and F2Pool‚Äôs block became stale as their block of transactions were reversed and as such became unconfirmed in the winning chain led by SlushPool and Binance.

This is atestament to the fact that the crypto-asset industry is evolving and maturing at high speed. Today, more than half a dozen blockchains offer different use cases such as applications in the decentralised finance sector built mainly on the Ethereum's Blockchain.\\\n\\\nHowever, the communication between these different blockchains is similar to that of mobile operators at the beginning of the 2000s, so connecting them is a Herculean task because they each have distinct structures preventing interoperability. Therefore, Polkadot presents itself as a solution to this critical problem, which allows the transfer of data and economic activities between all kinds of blockchains, using the crypto-asset (DOT) to encourage the right behaviour from the different actors of its ecosystem.\\\n\\\nThe Polkadot ETP's launch is the answer to the increasing demand from the European market to invest in cryptoassets on the stock exchange in a simple, regulated, and secure way, similar to the purchase of shares. As evidence of crypto-assets‚Äô interest and recognition investments in 21Shares trackers have increased five-fold in the third quarter of 2020.\n\nLearn more [here](https:\u002F\u002Ffinance.yahoo.com\u002Fnews\u002F21shares-launches-world-first-polkadot-073000824.html)."},{title:f,content:j}]},slug:"newsletter-issue-93"},{name:qX,date:"2021-02-09T13:41:49.542Z",category:e,tags:[],en:{title:qX,sections:[{title:h,content:"Bitcoin jumped to a record price of over $48,000 as Tesla invested $1.5 billion as stated in the Form 10-K ‚Äî an annual report required by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that gives a comprehensive summary of a company's financial performance [submitted](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.sec.gov\u002Fix?doc=\u002FArchives\u002Fedgar\u002Fdata\u002F1318605\u002F000156459021004599\u002Ftsla-10k_20201231.htm) by Tesla:\\\n\\\n‚Äú*As part of the policy, which was duly approved by the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, we may invest a portion of such cash in certain alternative reserve assets including digital assets, gold bullion, gold exchange-traded funds and other assets as specified in the future.

Since November 2018, we have quickly established our brand as a pioneer of Exchange Traded Products (ETPs), starting with listing HODL, the world's first ETP backed by a crypto basket.\\\n\\\nBy closely listening to investor demand and quickly adapting to the burgeoning crypto asset market, we offer an innovative and unique platform with ETPs listed on the largest regulated exchanges in several European countries to satisfy any investor type. Indeed, with an extended range of 12 cryptos ETPs under our wing, we enable anyone to invest in individual ETPs for Bitcoin and Ethereum with ABTC or AETH, but also in crypto baskets with HODL or KEYS and finally even in an inverse ETP called SBTC that tracks the daily inverse performance of Bitcoin for any adventurous investor who wants to possibly profit in the short term from the fall of Bitcoin's price. As a result, 21Shares is growing at a tremendous annual rate, with capital movements coming mainly from recognised financial institutions.\\\n\\\nInnovation and a sense of urgency are at the very heart of our culture at 21Shares, as our mission is to enable any type of investor to access in a regulated, secure and straightforward way the US$1 trillion+ crypto-asset industry. Our fine structure and wide range of ETPs provide institutional and retail investors with the most secure and convenient access and liquid exposure to this new asset class, which has been the fastest-growing over the past decade. Despite competition from new market entrants that largely replicate 21Shares' existing structures, we have continued to spearhead innovation in this area. 21Shares aims to continually bring new and innovative products to market, making investing in cryptoassets easier than ever. For example, last week we launched the world's first Polkadot (ADOT) tracker on the SIX Swiss stock exchange, which currently has over $6M in AUM.\\\n\\\nThis disruptive industry that is revolutionising both traditional finance and the tech sector is a global movement.

As we anticipated in our year-end review of 2020 with expectations for 2021, the new administration will provide more regulatory clarity specifically due to the fact that the new head of the SEC, Gary Gensler, is undeniably knowledgeable about the crypto industry as he taught a course at MIT on cryptocurrencies and the blockchain technology.\n\n**Why Does It Matter?**\n\nAs Bitcoin institutional and corporate attraction keeps growing, so does its valuation. As of February 16, Bitcoin‚Äôs market value amounts to over $900 billion and is on the verge of crossing the $1 trillion mark for the first time. Every other week, there have been more announcements regarding Bitcoin adoption, for example, MicroStrategy announced today another fundraise of $600 million through a convertible debt offering to buy more Bitcoin, while the oldest American bank, BNY Mellon with $2 trillion in AUM, plans to custody cryptoassets. The bank said they will hold, transfer and issue bitcoin on behalf of its asset-management clients. In the same vein, Purpose Investment, Inc. listed the world‚Äôs first Bitcoin ETF in Canada and subsequently the first ever in North America, while Mastercard, the leader in global payments connecting billions of consumers and thousands of financial institutions, is bringing cryptoassets onto its network.\n\nTo meet the demand of sophisticated investors and financial institutions alike, a Bitcoin ETP in the US will enable the cryptoasset to get to the mainstream as SEC Commissioner Pierce alluded to in her interview ‚Äî as people are looking for a way through regulated markets to access Bitcoin. It‚Äôs important to note the key differences between ETPs and ETFs as a Bitcoin ETP would not be an ETF therefore not a fund but rather a debt security. However, all ETPs are quoted and traded on stock exchanges throughout the trading day, like ordinary shares, while their prices are calculated with reference to an underlying index or reference asset like Bitcoin.\n\nThe brief rise of Bitcoin above the $50K mark has also led long-term investors to realize profits in this early bull market as we can observe with the ASOL metric on the image below. ASOL stands for ‚ÄúAverage Spent Outputs Lifespan‚Äù in other words the average age of bitcoins that move out of wallets. It‚Äôs a useful indicator for filtering out changes in older coin spending behaviour. This provides insight into the actions of longer-term and smart money investors. Tesla‚Äôs announcement from last week has significantly increased the average age of bitcoins being sold on exchanges from 30 days to more than 50 days.

The chart below shows the performance of the five largest cryptoassets by market value and an index of DeFi tokens.\n\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.mcauto-images-production.sendgrid.net\u002F3b7436794fe7d912\u002F3e5e322d-def8-40dd-9203-28bbd6b06cdb\u002F1440x718.png)\n\nAs we can see, the group's best-performing asset over the last 24-hour period, Bitcoin, has still declined more than 15% ‚Äî with other assets such as BNB declining as much as 21% after its drastic run-up over the last few weeks. The cause behind this downturn and correction was not because of a change in the fundamentals of cryptoassets, but rather an inevitable correction given how overleveraged the market had become and issues with the market microstructure of crypto-native exchanges.\\\n\\\nThis correction was not driven simply by spot selling but rather due to the downwards pressure of initial sell orders being exacerbated by a cascade of liquidations from overleveraged traders ‚Äî who often have access to up to 101x leverage on an asset class whose most mature asset, Bitcoin, [still averages daily volatility of above 3%](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.buybitcoinworldwide.com\u002Fvolatility-index\u002F).\n\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.mcauto-images-production.sendgrid.net\u002F3b7436794fe7d912\u002Fb08de3cb-8ed3-4882-bea7-131f92e11a7f\u002F1368x600.jpg)\n\nThere was over $5B worth of long liquidations over the last two days as traders were margin called on derivative exchanges due to the crash. As a result of [auto-deleveraging technology](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.bitmex.com\u002Fapp\u002FautoDeleveraging) on crypto exchanges where identity-based recourse measures are complicated, margin calls and the subsequent sales of the traders‚Äô positions can then, in fact, exacerbate market downturns ‚Äî as was the case over the last two days. This situation had occurred on occasions before over the previous year, most noticeably on March 12, where Bitcoin‚Äôs price was nearly halved in response to [liquidity and deleveraging issues](https:\u002F\u002Fdecrypt.co\u002F26299\u002Fblack-thursday-reshaped-bitcoin-futures-market-report) on the then leading derivatives exchange, BitMEX. These days, however, exchanges such as Binance Futures have overtaken BitMEX as the leading derivatives exchanges in volume and open interest.\\\n\\\nSuch issues associated with leverage are likely to persist but decrease over time, as more institutional infrastructure enters the market which will lead to a clawback on the amount of leverage users can take and reduce the influence of current unregulated derivatives exchanges in the market ‚Äî replacing them with institutional products such as 21Shares‚Äô ETP suite and futures exchanges such as the CME. During such events, the limits of prominent exchanges, such as Coinbase and Kraken, which have often gone offline during periods of volatility, is brought to the forefront of the market.\\\n\\\nWhile we know that, as the market continues to develop, issues caused by excessive leverage in the market will decrease. In the meantime, there are two key metrics that investors should keep an eye on to attempt to predict future events such as this: [funding rates](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.bybt.com\u002FFundingRate) and [open interest](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.bybt.com\u002FBitcoinOpenInterest). We will be going into further detail about these two metrics and how to use them to judge the market cycle in our [upcoming webinar with SwissQuote](https:\u002F\u002Fen.swissquote.com\u002Feducation\u002Fwebinars\u002Fhow-value-bitcoin-both-short-and-long-run-2021-03-03).\\\n\\\nThe massive decrease in market-wide open interest over the past two days indicates how much leverage has been flushed out of the system.\n\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.mcauto-images-production.sendgrid.net\u002F3b7436794fe7d912\u002Fdbac67ff-8c3e-4ccd-bdb8-d7d8e1892d8e\u002F1368x600.jpg)\n\nIn the absence of large institutional spot buying, March will likely be a period of consolidation for Bitcoin as the crash reduces market confidence and its propensity to overleverage itself. Given the amount of spot buying that has occurred up until the $45K mark for Bitcoin, it is unlikely that this phenomenon in-of-itself will lead to a total capitulation.\\\n\\\nIn fact, the recent news of [Bitfinex and Tether‚Äôs settlement with the New York Attorney General's (NYAG) office](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.ft.com\u002Fcontent\u002F1d3b5027-ce7e-470f-8d7a-866746f8079d) will remove the market‚Äôs largest potential black swan risk of legal action against the leading stablecoin and will likely lead to a reversion of some of the recent negative action."},{title:w,content:"The returns of the top five cryptoassets over the last week were as follows ‚Äî BTC (9.79%), ETH (-0.53%), BNB (104.78%), DOT (25.11%), and ADA (24.58%).\n\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.mcauto-images-production.sendgrid.net\u002F3b7436794fe7d912\u002Ff54f9cf6-e14d-438a-913e-5c496305126a\u002F1200x600.png)"},{title:"Monthly Returns",content:"The performance of our line of ETPs over the last 30 days is as follows: ABTC (39.9%), AETH (5.6%), ABCH (8.8%), AXRP (62%), ABNB (390.2%), AXTZ (5.1%), HODL (38.1%), ABBA (32.1%), KEYS (32.5%), SBTC (-36.7%), and ADOT (52.3%).\n\nLearn more about our products [here](https:\u002F\u002F21shares.com\u002Fproduct).\n\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.mcauto-images-production.sendgrid.net\u002F3b7436794fe7d912\u002Fe2ba0b12-71bd-4c1c-8266-d2d49d3e4353\u002F1200x600.png)"},{title:y,content:"Please save the date, next week, on March 3rd, Swissquote will host an exclusive webinar session with the 21Shares team composed of our CEO, Hany Rashwan and our Research Associates, Eli√©zer Ndinga and Lanre Ige.

We dedicate this post to thank every single member of the 21Shares team for their hard work, dedication, and commitment to our mission of simplifying the investing experience in the burgeoning crypto industry. We also want to express our gratitude to our partners and clients for trusting us as the go-to asset manager with the most expansive and innovative product suite in the market.\n\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.mcauto-images-production.sendgrid.net\u002F3b7436794fe7d912\u002F2a50aff7-c6d4-4755-83ae-f354e29c0927\u002F1600x900.png)\n\n**Why Does It Matter?**\\\n\\\nThis important milestone can largely be attributed to two phenomena:\n\nA rapid appreciation and acceptance from institutional investors of the cryptoasset industry. Since its lows of $5,000 in March 2020, Bitcoin has grown to, at its highs, a value of $55,000 in February 2021 ‚Äî as it has become a trillion-dollar asset last week. To give examples of the increasing institutional interest in Bitcoin, the largest asset manager globally, BlackRock, has started to dabble in Bitcoin. At the same time, Jeffrey Gundlach, a long-time gold bull, admitted that Bitcoin might be a better trade than gold and coined the cryptoasset as the \"Stimulus Asset\".\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum's network usage has increased from $950 million to over $43 billion over the same time period, with transaction fees representing over 50% of miners‚Äô revenue on the network. The exorbitant growth in the sector with reference to both its fundamentals and its popularity has sparked demand globally from institutional investors in this niche asset class.\n\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.mcauto-images-production.sendgrid.net\u002F3b7436794fe7d912\u002Fc2dc2ad2-d38e-4c3d-87b1-0106d7b8e4e6\u002F1600x896.png)\n\nOur proven track record listing physically-backed ETPs gives retail and institutional investors safe, convenient, and easy access to cryptocurrencies via a familiar structure. Institutions in Europe and elsewhere prefer the institutional-grade structure of the Swiss ETP over certificates to gain exposure most efficiently and safely to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The Swiss ETP structure - first utilised by 21Shares AG via the HODL crypto basket ETP - shares many characteristics of traditional ETF structures such as an approved EU prospectus, listing on regulated European exchanges, open-ended using creations\u002Fredemptions to prevent premiums and discounts, full segregation and collateralisation of the underlying assets and utilising many ETF market makers for intraday liquidity. Since the UCITs diversification requirements do not constrain the Swiss ETP structure, it is ideal for giving investors safe access to more nascent and desired asset classes.\n\n‚ÄúWe are extremely excited to have reached a critical milestone in such a short period of time. The growth in 21Shares ETP‚Äôs business is largely due to the incredible efforts of our team and the loyalty and trust of our investors,‚Äù said Ophelia Snyder, co-Founder and President of 21Shares.\n\nSince our inception, we have launched a total of 12 different crypto asset trackers on all regulated exchanges in the D-A-CH region. The company is the only issuer that currently has an Ethereum ETP (AETH) on 2 regulated stock exchanges and 3 regulated exchange segments offering the bitcoin ETP. No other crypto issuer has such a comprehensive offering on regulated markets. As such, we own over 90% of the market share of crypto basket ETPs, and our latest product, the Polkadot ETP, has gathered over $25million in 15 days, demonstrating the immense popularity of the 21Shares suite of crypto ETPs.\n\nWe were also the first issuer to list the XRP ETP (AXRP), which is still listed and traded under normal market conditions under its current regulatory scrutiny. We also gained instant recognition for listing the world‚Äôs first short bitcoin ETP (SBTC), which is centrally cleared for added compliance support on the Frankfurt Stock exchange. Also, we are the only issuer to have 9 cryptoasset ETPs admitted to trading on the Stuttgart exchange.\n\n‚ÄúWith such institutional demand wanting to gain exposure to crypto via an ISIN, it took us less than two weeks from announcing $500 million in AuM to now exceeding $1 billion. It is rapidly becoming judicious for many wealth managers, private banks, family offices and individuals to allocate to crypto assets. We expect to reach even greater heights in 2021 across both our AuM at 21Shares as well as across the crypto ecosystem.‚Äù commented Hany Rashwan, CEO of 21Shares.\n\nLearn more [here](https:\u002F\u002Fuk.finance.yahoo.com\u002Fnews\u002Fswiss-crypto-etp-issuer-hits-070000598.html)."},{title:f,content:j}],title:"21Shares Research Newsletter ‚Äì Issue 96"}},{tags:[C,A],date:"2021-03-02T08:14:52.980Z",slug:"newsletter-issue-97",category:e,en:{title:"21Shares Research Newsletter ‚Äì Issue 97",sections:[{title:h,content:"The last few days have seen a derivatives-liquidation-driven flash crash within the crypto asset market, exacerbated by a bearish adjustment of the [bond markets‚Äô inflation expectations](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.bloomberg.com\u002Fopinion\u002Farticles\u002F2021-02-25\u002Fbond-market-screams-for-help-but-no-one-answers '\\\u003Cspan style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#1155cc;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:underline;-webkit-text-decoration-skip:none;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\"\u003E bond markets‚Äô inflation expectations\\\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E'), then followed by a spot-driven recovery across crypto sectors.\n\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.mcauto-images-production.sendgrid.net\u002F3b7436794fe7d912\u002Fe556944a-dea2-4206-abe7-372c5fa23ad2\u002F1872x792.png)\n\nAll the major crypto assets such as Bitcoin (1%), Ethereum (-3.2%), BNB (-0.6%), Polkadot (8.1%), and the wider DeFi market (8.5%) have, for the most part, recovered their losses since February 25. Such a pattern is relatively common within the current market due to a large amount of leverage currently within the system and the aggressive deleveraging systems; both factors mean that following large spot-selloffs, the derivatives markets tend to overreact.\n\nHowever, as has been the case several times before, the spot market for Bitcoin and other crypto assets tends to buy back the assets following the exacerbated sell-off. As was the case yesterday notably with Microstrategy [buying](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.bloomberg.com\u002Fnews\u002Farticles\u002F2021-03-01\u002Fmicrostrategy-raises-bitcoin-holdings-to-more-than-4-billion '\\\u003Cspan style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#4a6ee0;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:underline;-webkit-text-decoration-skip:none;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\"\u003Ebuying\\\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E') another $15M of Bitcoin to increase their total holdings to over $4B. Two key metrics to now watch are: (1) any premium that emerges on Coinbase due to institutional buying; (2) Any notable increase in Bitcoin outflows from Coinbase. Both metrics have been strong indicators of past institutional and corporate buying which has preceded a new leg-up in Bitcoin prices.\n\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.mcauto-images-production.sendgrid.net\u002F3b7436794fe7d912\u002F4b8d15e7-6adc-4665-ad72-5e2426c31d80\u002F1139x330.png)\n\nThese have often been placed following a large options expiry date (February 26) and after a deleveraging of the market.

Under this new paradigm, Ethereum can be valued similarly to other commodities, and this new deflationary pressure will likely lead to a repricing of the asset.\n\n**What Is Ethereum?**\n\nEthereum is the second-largest cryptoasset by its market value of approximately $200 billion, after Bitcoin ($1 trillion), and represents the largest single innovation within the cryptoasset blockchain industry since the creation of Bitcoin in 2009. \n\nWhile Bitcoin is the world‚Äôs first decentralised, peer-to-peer digital currency and is considered the world‚Äôs first digital gold, Ethereum is the first form of digital oil, serving as a fuel to use a world‚Äôs computer, the Ethereum blockchain. For example, entrepreneurs build on Ethereum decentralised financial services standing for Decentralized Finance (DeFi), which disrupt conventional finance such as market making, trading and lending, to name a few. \n\nEthereum‚Äôs key feature is smart contracts, which are computer programs that exist on the blockchain to automate financial activity and, to some extent, reduce intermediaries we know in traditional finance such as brokers, market makers, etc. Demand for Ethereum as a digital oil and smart contracts has helped Ethereum (AETH | ISIN: CH0454664027) return 1,318% since the start of 2020, compared to 642% for Bitcoin, and 18% for the S&P500.\n\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.mcauto-images-production.sendgrid.net\u002F3b7436794fe7d912\u002Fe5038e17-291b-4ce3-af6f-e2fd696731ae\u002F1440x718.png)\n\nDecentralised finance refers to a technology effort to recreate existing financial services such as saving, lending, and investing in a decentralised manner using the Ethereum blockchain‚Äôs power.\n\n**What is the network upgrade?**\n\nEthereum‚Äôs next network upgrade in July will revamp the network‚Äôs economic model and create a deflationary supply shock as demand for decentralised financial services has significantly increased over the past months, with over[ $40 billion](https:\u002F\u002Fdefipulse.com\u002F) in total assets across applications.\n\nThe network upgrade, called EIP-1559, aims to make it easier for users of Ethereum to calculate the transaction fees they need to pay to interact with decentralised financial services. It does this by assigning a minimum and dynamic fee that users pay and permanently removed from Ethereum‚Äôs supply. This means that there will be deflationary pressure on Ethereum as demand increases, in the same way as many other heavily-coveted commodities such as oil function.\n\nBitcoin‚Äôs value is predicated on its fixed supply cap of 21,000,000 bitcoin. Ethereum will take a similar approach where, over the long-term, the asset may see a deflationary supply as demand for decentralised finance increases. The upcoming network upgrade will enable investors to rethink Ethereum as a digital oil or commodity and, therefore, price it.\n\n**What is the likely outcome?**\n\nEthereum‚Äôs upcoming network upgrade will likely see a repricing of the asset as investor expectations shift away from viewing Ethereum as a speculative currency to viewing it as a digital commodity. Ethereum will be priced based on demand (for transaction fees) and supply (amount of ETH created and burned) in a similar way to how gas and oil are valued. This fact will likely greatly expand the types of investors who are comfortable seeking exposure to the asset. In recent weeks, we‚Äôve heard of businesses allocated to Ethereum as a buffer for its future need for their decentralised finance use cases ‚Äî it would not be surprising to see banks in the future do the same.\n\nInvestors who are already comfortable with making investments in other commodities will take advantage of getting exposure to the world‚Äôs most popular digital commodity and the fuel for decentralised finance. Investors can already access Ethereum exposure through our 21Shares Ethereum ETP (AETH | ISIN: CH0454664027). Today, we are proud to have listed our Ethereum ETP on Deutsche Borse, effectively becoming the first-ever Ethereum ETP listed on this regulated venue. ‚ÄúAfter the immensely successful launch of the first Polkadot ETP just a month ago, we are working on several more launches in the second and third quarter,‚Äù said Hany Rashwan, CEO 21Shares.\n\nThe performance of other smart contract competitors in 2021 is a signal of how well we can expect Ethereum to perform as it reclaims its lead. As the chart below shows, Ethereum competitors have performed between 289-868% compared to 148% for Ethereum since the start of the year. Based on the fundamental paradigm shift from the upcoming network upgrade, Etheruem is well-positioned to outperform.\n\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.mcauto-images-production.sendgrid.net\u002F3b7436794fe7d912\u002Ffb821d69-895c-47bd-86e7-a41445672679\u002F1440x718.png)"},{title:w,content:"The returns of the top five crypto assets over the last week were as follows ‚Äî BTC (7.83%), ETH (22.57%), BNB (-0.14%), DOT (-3.30%), and ADA (-8.71%).\n\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.mcauto-images-production.sendgrid.net\u002F3b7436794fe7d912\u002F15d02c6c-81c7-43c9-9417-57e595bf001d\u002F1200x600.png)"},{title:_,content:"The performance of our line of ETPs over the last 30 days is as follows: ABTC (22%), AETH (10.9%), ABCH (10.9%), AXRP (4.9%), ABNB (147.6%), AXTZ (26.1%), HODL (28.1%), ABBA (20.3%), KEYS (15%), SBTC (-18.6%), and ADOT (60.7%).\n\n\nYou can learn more about our products [here](https:\u002F\u002F21shares.com\u002Fproduct\u002F).\n\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.mcauto-images-production.sendgrid.net\u002F3b7436794fe7d912\u002F22b1dda5-3d00-4a99-8841-b4594152bd29\u002F1200x600.png)"},{title:y,content:"How to value an emerging store of value that has grown by more than 5 billion percent since its first-ever trade of $0.0009 in 2010?

Our am¬≠bi¬≠tion is to be a valu¬≠able part¬≠ner in new re¬≠new¬≠able projects.*‚Äù ‚Äî Kjell Inge R√∏kke.\n\n**Why Does It Matter?**\n\nIt's been documented and established that Bitcoin shares many characteristics of gold, and for this reason, Bitcoin is usually described as digital gold. By relying on the market-sizing method, we can estimate the total addressable market ([TAM](https:\u002F\u002Fblog.hubspot.com\u002Fmarketing\u002Ftotal-addressable-market)) for Bitcoin, which in this specific case is the market capitalisation of gold [valued](https:\u002F\u002F8marketcap.com\u002Fmetals\u002F) at approximately $10 trillion. Note, there are other key elements to consider, such as [strong network security](https:\u002F\u002Fbtc.com\u002Fstats\u002Fdiff) and decentralisation preventing attacks, and the growing use of [renewable energy sources](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.coindesk.com\u002Fthe-last-word-on-bitcoins-energy-consumption) for mining Bitcoin, just to name a few.\n\nIn theory, if Bitcoin reaches the market value of gold, the price per bitcoin will be more than $500,000. To be more specific, by dividing the market cap of gold by the outstanding number of bitcoins ‚Äî hence 10 trillion divided by 18.6 million, we get a Bitcoin price of roughly $535,000.\n\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.mcauto-images-production.sendgrid.net\u002F3b7436794fe7d912\u002F10f1df71-039f-4fc2-9083-662c97643e00\u002F1600x716.png)\n\nAt 21Shares, we believe that Bitcoin has the chance to exceed the market value of gold. Bitcoin is a digital native asset, accessible anywhere in the world with an internet connection. The asset has a fixed, predictable supply of 21 million units ending in approximately 119 years, which since inception is programmatically-declining every four years (i.e., the halving). More importantly, in the context of social distancing, closed borders, and fear of virus transmission ‚Äî unlike gold, Bitcoin is easily transferable like emails and billions of dollars worth of BItcoin could be stored in a USB key also called storage in the industry (though as a [rule of thumb](https:\u002F\u002Fmedium.com\u002F@nic__carter\u002Fits-the-settlement-assurances-stupid-5dcd1c3f4e41), it‚Äôs recommended to wait an hour or roughly six blocks, added to the blockchain approximately every 10 minutes, to make sure a transaction is confirmed). Finally, the Bitcoin blockchain is tamper-resistant, open-source, and verified by anyone; give it a look [here](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.blockchain.com\u002Fexplorer). \n\nAll the points above make the case as to why Bitcoin is better than gold. Note this analysis does not take into account the incredible innovations atop of Bitcoin such as the Lightning Network and Stacks, which could expand the potential total addressable market by orders of magnitude and also the use cases documented by the Human Rights Foundation, proving that Bitcoin serves as an alternative and censorship-resistant monetary system to protect human rights. \n\nGold, unlike Bitcoin, is shiny and benefits from the test of time with thousands of years under its belt.

The petition, [hosted](https:\u002F\u002Fpetitions.senat.fr\u002Finitiatives\u002Fi-602) on the Senate's website, is live until September 5th this year and requires at least 100,000 signatures to be passed onto the Conference of Presidents to review the matter. So far, it has gathered more than 670 signatures, one of which from a french lawmaker, Jean-Michel BIS, of the National Assembly, the lower house of the French Parliament ‚Äî who [publicly](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.linkedin.com\u002Fposts\u002Fjean-michel-mis-36944535_amendement-au-code-mon%C3%A9taire-et-financier-activity-6776227042779295744-kiD6) voiced his support on the amendment.\n\n\"France cannot decently remain as an observer of a race which has already started. Not owning bitcoin will put it in a financially weak position within 5-10 years. It is urgent to take up the matter.\" ‚Äî said Francois-Xavier Thoorens in the petition.\n\n**What Does It Matter?**\n\nOur [year-end review](https:\u002F\u002F21shares.com\u002Fresearch\u002F2020) also outlines our predictions for 2021. We have predicted the increased interest and adoption of Bitcoin from conventional financial institutions broadly in the US and Western Europe. This petition is significant, especially with a signature coming from a member of the National Assembly. European countries are culturally and historically known to be more cautious and conservatives when it comes to investing than their neighbours across the Atlantic ocean in North America.\\\n\\\nSurprisingly, the crypto market‚Äôs adoption from a regulatory standpoint has shown the opposite of this stereotype. For example, in Europe, institutional-grade investment vehicles are listed on regulated stock exchanges functioning like ETFs, such as 21Shares‚Äô ETPs. On the other hand, in the US, most of these vehicles are investment trusts traded over the counter, which lack redemption programs and, as such, are subject to often-large [premiums and discounts](https:\u002F\u002F21shares.com\u002Fresearch\u002Fgrayscale-premium-update-21shares-bitcoin-etp) relative to NAV.\\\n\\\nThis call to amend the French monetary code is a testament to the growing recognition of Bitcoin as an emerging store of value, the type of adoption we have never seen before, which will continue to attract a wave of new investors outside of the retail cohort. For instance, Goldman Sachs published their survey results, indicating that [40%](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.coindesk.com\u002F40-of-goldman-sachs-clients-reported-exposure-to-crypto-survey) of their clients have exposure to cryptoassets. At the same time, Bloomberg reported the [acceleration](https:\u002F\u002Fassets.bbhub.io\u002Fpromo\u002Fsites\u002F12\u002F1029441_Crypto-Mar2021Outlook.pdf) of Bitcoin as a replacement to gold in portfolios. Although this petition might not come to fruition as before the French National Assembly‚Äôs reviewing phase, the petition requires at least 100,000 signatures. This endeavour, however, sets the tone for how this cycle could be shaped and what we might expect going forward. For the record, the price of Bitcoin is three times its previous all-time high of $19,9K, and at 21Shares, we will closely follow what the future holds on all fronts.\n\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.mcauto-images-production.sendgrid.net\u002F3b7436794fe7d912\u002Fd44a7246-b5bf-4b8a-a834-949f72afaf31\u002F1600x1200.png)\n\nLearn more [here](https:\u002F\u002Fnews.bitcoin.com\u002Ffrench-lawmaker-petition-central-bank-buy-hold-bitcoin\u002F)."},{title:f,content:j}]}},{de:{title:u,content:gO,file:gP},en:{title:u,content:gO,file:gP},it:{title:u,content:gO,file:gP},name:"Our Thesis for Crypto | Bitcoin",slug:"our-thesis-for-crypto",fr:{title:u,content:gO,file:gP},date:q$,tags:[C],type:aR,image:"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002F15-500x620.png",category:ax},{de:{title:fu,file:"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fuploads\u002Fcurrent-documents\u002Fdot-primer-main-de.pdf",content:"Diese Forschungsfibel ist ein Leitfaden zum Verst√§ndnis der Smart-Contract-Plattform Polkadot.

Whilst we expect a lot more detail about the project to be unveiled soon, we can look at the data behind Facebook to better understand the potential scale of the Libra project.\n\nWhilst it is still not entirely clear how the Libra project will fit into Facebook‚Äôs existing suite of products, it has been [reported](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.coindesk.com\u002Ffacebook-is-working-on-its-own-stablecoin-for-money-transfers-report) that it will be some kind of stablecoin allowing for payments across the company‚Äôs various messaging applications.

Moreover, given the geographic breakdown of Facebook‚Äôs users recently, where user growth seems to be driven primarily from the Asia-Pacific and African regions, it seems a sensible idea to focus the Libra project on the remittance markets in those regions.\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Flibra2.html\" width=\"100%\" height=\"520\" frameBorder=\"0\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\nThe stark difference in user growth between the Asia-Pacific and Rest of World regions compared to the United States & Canada, and Europe, is even more noticeable when we take a look at how MAU values change over time.\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Flibra3.html\" width=\"100%\" height=\"520\" frameBorder=\"0\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\nThis data seems to point to the fact that the Asia-Pacific and Rest of World regions have been the drivers of Facebook‚Äôs growth in recent times and a remittances payment application powered by the company‚Äôs native crypto asset could act as the impetus behind further growth in those regions.\n\nHistorically, Facebook‚Äôs revenue has largely come from its digital advertising services across Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp, and other applications. The other significant revenue stream for Facebook has been the net fees it has received from developers using their payments infrastructure. Below we‚Äôve plotted the percentage of total revenue generated by Facebook‚Äôs payment vertical over time.\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Flibra4.html\" width=\"100%\" height=\"520\" frameBorder=\"0\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\nThe share of revenue brought in by payments has reduced massively since its high of 15.92% in 2012. Due to potential worries over the long-term viability of digital advertising as a cash cow, the Libra project presents an opportunity for Facebook to turn its payments vertical into a significant revenue stream once again.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe Libra project is a strategic move by Facebook to take advantage of potential opportunities in developing economies primarily within the Asia-Pacific and Africa regions. A Facebook-backed crypto asset would have instant access to over 2 billion people across the main Facebook application, WhatsApp, and Instagram ‚Äì meaning that the project could help expose an unprecedented number of people to the crypto asset market. If successful, the Libra project could help reinvigorate Facebook‚Äôs existing payments vertical as the company attempts to move away from its reliance on digital advertising.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThe information provided does not constitute a prospectus or other offering material and does not contain or constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of any offer to buy securities in any jurisdiction.\n\nSome of the information published herein may contain forward-looking statements.

This research note will analyze the key regulatory issues of 2019 thus far, giving an overview of the issue in question along with its impact and long-term implications.\n\n# The Bitfinex-Tether NYAG Investigation\n\n**Overview**\n\nOn April 25 2019, [news](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.theblockcrypto.com\u002F2019\u002F04\u002F25\u002Fny-attorney-general-sues-bitfinex-and-tether\u002F) broke that the New York Attorney General office had sued Bitfinex and Tether on allegation of fraud carried out by the companies against users in the state of New York. The key [allegation](https:\u002F\u002Fiapps.courts.state.ny.us\u002Ffbem\u002FDocumentDisplayServlet?documentId=vIexA1b0spKOnK_PLUS_ZUGTJ3A==&system=prod) was that Bitfinex and Tether had engaged in ‚Äúundisclosed, conflicted transactions to cover Bitfinex‚Äôs losses by transferring money out of tether (USDT) reserve funds‚Äù. In total, around $700 million had been drained from Tether‚Äôs reserves and a line of credit had been issued to Bitfinex for loans totaling up to $900 million. The reason why Bitfinex had required the line of credit was because of the loss or theft of around $850 million of their funds by Crypto Capital ‚Äì a Panama-based payment processor who had been helping the exchange handle customer withdrawals. Bitfinex has since [responded](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.bitfinex.com\u002Fposts\u002F356) to NYAG‚Äôs allegations and the investigation is ongoing.\n\n**Impact**\n\nOne of our past [research](https:\u002F\u002F21shares.com\u002Fresearch\u002F2019\u002F04\u002F29\u002Fbreaking-down-the-tether-bitfinex-investigation-and-its-aftermath\u002F) notes went into great detail about the immediate impact of the news of the NYAG investigation.  The charts below compare pricing on Bitfinex for the BTC\u002FUSD trading pair with that of Coinbase and Kraken. One can see that, once the news broke, Bitfinex‚Äôs trading pair had been consistently trading at a premium to that of its competitors as investors try to get their funds out of the exchange.\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Ftether8.html\" width=\"100%\" height=\"330\" frameBorder=\"0\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Ftether9.html\" width=\"100%\" height=\"330\" frameBorder=\"0\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\nOn the day of the news, the premium was as much as 3% when compared to the averages of Kraken and Coinbase Pro. This point becomes even more obvious when we begin to look at Bitfinex‚Äôs on-chain inflows and outflows and how they have changed since the news broke. Below we plot the net outflows for both ETH and BTC on Bitfinex (Data: [Token Analyst](https:\u002F\u002Ftokenanalyst.io\u002F)).\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Ftether10.html\" width=\"100%\" height=\"330\" frameBorder=\"0\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Ftether11.html\" width=\"100%\" height=\"330\" frameBorder=\"0\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\nMoreover, another helpful metric to ascertain the effect the news had on users‚Äô behavior is the number of new stable coins which have been issued since the April 25th announcement.\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Ftether13-2.html\" width=\"100%\" height=\"330\" frameBorder=\"0\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\nThe spike in issuances amongst three of the most popular stable coins (PAX, TUSD, USDC) is noticeable and the highest it has been in the two months period around the news. The previous data showed the short-term impact of the news but two months on, the impact of the news can still be felt.\n\n**Implications**\n\nBitfinex and Tether had always been met with some caution from some within the industry due to their sour history of hacks and fund withdrawal issues. However, the market has failed to react as strongly as some would expect following the data immediately following the news. For example, Bitfinex has remained one of the world‚Äôs most prominent crypto asset exchanges. Below we plot the most exchange‚Äôs trading volume for the BTC\u002FUSD pair from the start of the year. Bitfinex has maintained a steady share of overall volume throughout the year despite the news.\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Freg1-1.html\" width=\"100%\" height=\"660\" frameBorder=\"0\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\nWhilst the outcome of the NYAG investigation is uncertain, Bitfinex‚Äôs launch of their LEO token can be said to have been the greatest resultant event of the drama. In order to raise funds to make up for Bitfinex‚Äôs and Tether‚Äôs aforementioned shortfall, the firm reportedly raised $1 billion in a [token sale](https:\u002F\u002Ft.co\u002F74N1Ngn8NY) for an exchange token ‚Äì LEO. The token was listed on Bitfinex on Monday 21 May and will be bought back and ‚Äò[burned](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.coindesk.com\u002Fbitfinex-is-starting-to-buy-back-and-burn-its-leo-exchange-token)‚Äò on a pre-defined schedule using Bitfinex‚Äôs accrued exchange fees, any funds recovered from Crypto Capital, and 80% of funds recovered from their 2016 [hack](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.coindesk.com\u002Fbitfinex-most-user-funds-offline).\n\nLEO has performed exceptionally well since its listing ‚Äì having returned around 76.6% to date. The chart below plots LEO‚Äôs price and trading volume on Bitfinex since May 21.\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Freg2.html\" width=\"100%\" height=\"660\" frameBorder=\"0\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\nMoreover, we show the total amount of LEO which has been burned thus far.\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Freg3-1.html\" width=\"100%\" height=\"660\" frameBorder=\"0\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\nDespite the ostensible implications of the NYAG investigation which could greatly impact Bitfinex‚Äôs ability to operate in the United States in the long term, the exchange seems to have survived relatively unscathed thus far. We expect this to change as the investigation progresses and there is the chance that the crypto asset market has not sufficiently priced in the possible negative long term consequences of the investigation.\n\n# The KIK SEC Lawsuit\n\n**Overview**\n\nOn June 4 [news](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.theblockcrypto.com\u002F2019\u002F06\u002F05\u002Fkiks-troubles-mount-as-sec-files-suit-claiming-securities-law-violation-lawyers-say\u002F) broke that the SEC would be suing Kik for organizing what they judged to be an unregistered securities offering when it conducted its $100 million ICO in 2017 for their KIN token. This was not the first time the SEC had come after a token sale project for failing to register their token sale as a securities offering ‚Äì other examples include [Paragon](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.coindesk.com\u002Fsec-fined-crypto-project-abandons-cannabis-co-working-space-plan) and [Airfox](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.sec.gov\u002Fnews\u002Fpress-release\u002F2018-264). However, this case was undoubtedly the most prominent and the first time of note where the accused party has refused to settle with the SEC, meaning that the lawsuit would be likely to go to courts.\n\n**Impact**\n\nThere was an immediate impact on KIN‚Äôs price following the news.\n\nThe price of KIN fell from $0.000035 to $0.000027 following the news, with the token down more than 98% from its all-time high of $0.001493 in early 2018. The market certainly hasn‚Äôt judged the news of the lawsuit favorably in any way given the [difficulties](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.coindesk.com\u002Fsec-negotiations-have-cost-kik-5-million-says-ceo) KIK has already faced throughout the legal challenge.\n\nThe other impact from the news was KIK‚Äôs launch of the [Defend Crypto fund](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.defendcrypto.org\u002F) ‚Äì supported by the likes of Messari, ShapeShift, and Arrington XRP Capital. The fund was set up to aid in KIK‚Äôs legal battle against the SEC on their token‚Äôs characterization as an unregistered security.\n\nIn the fund‚Äôs own words: ‚ÄúFor the future of crypto, we all need Kik to win. This case will set a precedent and could serve as the new [Howey Test](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.sec.gov\u002Fcorpfin\u002Fframework-investment-contract-analysis-digital-assets) for how cryptocurrencies are regulated in the United States. That‚Äôs why we set up the Defend Crypto fund to ensure that the funds are there to do this the right way. Kin has already spent over $5MM and is committing another $5MM of BTC, ETH, and KIN in our Coinbase account to fight this out on behalf of the industry.‚Äù The Defend Crypto fund has raised around $5,603,646  (including the amount committed by Kin) thus far.\n\n**Implications**\n\nAs Defend Crypto has already argued, the KIK-SEC lawsuit‚Äôs outcomes will have longstanding implications for the crypto asset industry. KIK‚Äôs argument as for why their KIN token should not be considered a security rests on the argument of the token being ‚Äú[sufficiently decentralized](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.sec.gov\u002Flitigation\u002Fcomplaints\u002F2019\u002Fcomp-pr2019-87.pdf)‚Äú. It remains to be seen if such an argument holds up in court and, if so, under what ground.\n\n# Exchange Compliance\n\n**Overview**\n\nOver the last month, we have heard news of [Poloniex](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.coindesk.com\u002Fpolinex-fearing-regulatory-backlash-prevents-sale-of-9-crypto-assets-in-us) and [Bittrex](https:\u002F\u002Fbittrex.zendesk.com\u002Fhc\u002Fen-us\u002Farticles\u002F360029523891-Market-Availability-Changes-for-U-S-Customers-6-28-19) both delisting certain crypto assets due to the regulatory pressure in the United States. Moreover, Binance recently [announced](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.coindesk.com\u002Fbinance-exchange-to-block-crypto-trading-for-u-s-customers) that they would be blocking U.S customers from July 1 whilst simultaneously launching a ‚Äúregulatory compliant‚Äù portal for the same customer base. These news stories demonstrate the fear crypto asset exchanges have over the potential risk of offering crypto assets likely to be deemed unregistered securities to U.S. customers. Poloniex wrote in a [blog post ](https:\u002F\u002Fmedium.com\u002Fcircle-trader\u002Fpoloniex-to-stop-offering-trading-of-9-assets-to-us-customers-all-assets-remain-available-to-b4c5703c0e9)accompanying the delisting that ‚ÄúIt is not possible to be certain whether US regulators will consider these assets to be securities.‚Äù\n\n**Impact and Implications**\n\nWe expect further delistings over the year as exchanges try to air on the side of caution with U.S. securities law. Moreover, further delistings from US-based exchanges will only serve to further empower international exchanges like Binance and Bitfinex as they become the only place where investors can purchase new crypto assets which may have some amount of regulatory uncertainty surrounding them.\n\nBelow we plot the number of trading pairs available on Binance, Kraken, Poloniex, and Bittrex and compare trading pairs overlap (in percentage terms) with Binance.\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Freg5.html\" width=\"100%\" height=\"630\" frameBorder=\"0\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Freg6.html\" width=\"100%\" height=\"630\" frameBorder=\"0\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\nMore recently the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) released a set of standards that require that ‚Äúvirtual asset service providers‚Äù (VASPs), including crypto exchanges, pass information about their customers to one another when transferring funds between firms. Only adding to the regulatory overhead faced by crypto asset exchanges.\n\n# The Bitcoin ETF\n\n**Overview**\n\nOver the last few years, a number of entities have been vying to launch a US-based Bitcoin ETF including VanEck, Bitwise, and the Winklevoss Brothers. Since the Winklevoss brothers filed with the SEC in July 2013 for the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, a number of companies have tried and failed to launch a Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. The SEC has had many reasons for its past rejections, including concerns over market manipulation, liquidity, and financial crime.\n\n**Impact and Implications**\n\nThe below chart shows a timeline of significant events relevant to the various Bitcoin ETF applications over the years.\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Freg7.html\" width=\"100%\" height=\"630\" frameBorder=\"0\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\nIt remains uncertain as to how likely the SEC is to approve any future Bitcoin ETF proposal, though it is without a doubt that the approval of a Bitcoin ETF could act as a large impetus behind future capital inflows into Bitcoin and other crypto assets.\n\n# Libra\n\n**Overview**\n\nThe crypto asset industry was shaken last week by the [news](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.theblockcrypto.com\u002F2019\u002F06\u002F18\u002F10-most-important-things-you-need-to-know-about-facebooks-new-cryptocurrency-libra\u002F) that Facebook would be launching their own crypto asset called Libra. In the wake of the announcement several politicians, governmental and bodies, and regulators across the world have aired their concerns about Facebook‚Äôs project. Below are a few of the comments made:\n\nFrance‚Äôs finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, [said](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.theblockcrypto.com\u002Ftiny\u002Ffacebooks-cryptocurrency-libra-decried-by-french-finance-minister-saying-it-must-not-happen\u002F) Libra ‚Äúcan‚Äôt and‚Ä¶must not happen‚Äù and that ‚Äúit is out of question‚Äô‚Äô for the crypto asset to ‚Äúbecome a sovereign currency.‚Äù Moreover, he called on Group of Seven (G-7) central bank governors and guardians of the global monetary system to review the social media giant‚Äôs upcoming crypto asset and submit a report next month.\n\nU.S. Representative  Patrick McHenry [asked](https:\u002F\u002Fpbs.twimg.com\u002Fmedia\u002FD9XzYDtXYAY2cx4.jpg) for a hearing on Libra\n\nU.S. Representative Maxine Waters [called](https:\u002F\u002Fpbs.twimg.com\u002Fmedia\u002FD9X23AhWkAE-Fk4.png) for a halt on the development of Libra\n\nBank of England governor Mark Carney has emained open-minded about Libra but also [said](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.ft.com\u002Fcontent\u002F189c1c66-91dd-11e9-aea1-2b1d33ac3271) regulators would not give the crypto asset an ‚Äúopen door‚Äù.\n\nFrance will [create](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.reuters.com\u002Farticle\u002Fus-facebook-crypto-france\u002Ffrance-creating-g7-cryptocurrency-taskforce-says-central-banker-idUSKCN1TM0SO) a G7 taskforce on ‚Äústablecoin‚Äù projects following the Libra announcement\n\nU.S. Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell [said](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.theblockcrypto.com\u002Ftiny\u002Ffed-chair-powell-says-central-bank-has-spoken-with-facebook-about-libra\u002F) that the central bank had already spoken to Facebook about Libra\n\n**Impact and Implications**\n\nGiven how the recency of the announcement it is difficult to fully grasp the scale of impact of the regulatory uncertainty around Libra. However, we do believe that regulators around the world are likely to present several hurdles to a successful Libra launch especially given anti-trust concerns surrounding Facebook. We expect the implementation of Libra to be very much affected by feedback from regulators, presenting the possibility the final product in 2020 could be quite different from what was presented in the white paper.\n\n# Conclusion\n\n2019 has been a unique year for the crypto asset industry partly due to the increased regulatory scrutiny it has faced. We believe the themes we have touched on in this research note will continue to develop over the next year and greatly shape the industry and market dynamics. In the long term, the development of friendly and transparent regulation for the crypto asset industry is a necessity if it is to fulfill its potential. As the aforementioned investigations, lawsuits, and events progress and eventually reach their conclusions we are likely to see a much more mature industry, primed for institutional and mainstream adoption.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThe information provided does not constitute a prospectus or other offering material and does not contain or constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of any offer to buy securities in any jurisdiction.\n\nSome of the information published herein may contain forward-looking statements.

This news is substantial for two reasons; firstly, Tether is one of the most actively traded crypto assets and serves an important role as the quote currency on exchanges without access to fiat liquidity. Currently, the outstanding tether is not fully backed by US dollars but only partially. Given this fact, there is a significant amount of risk of tether losing its parity to the US dollar or even experiencing a ‚Äòbank run‚Äô. Secondly, Bitfinex is exposed to considerable legal risk due to the NYAG‚Äôs investigation. Whilst the investigation is still in the early stages, such serious charges present existential risks to the exchange. This article will help the reader understand the role that both Bitfinex and Tether have historically played within crypto asset markets and then assess what impact the NYAG‚Äôs allegations will have on the companies and the wider crypto asset market.\n\n# Background\n\n[Bitfinex](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.bitfinex.com\u002F) is a crypto asset exchange founded in 2012, owned and operated by iFinex Inc and headquartered in Hong Kong but registered in the British Virgin Islands. The exchange was founded by Jean-Louis van der velde (Chief Executive Officer), Giancarlo Devasini (Chief Financial Officer) and Raphael Nicolle. Over the last few years, Bitfinex has become a leading crypto asset exchange. For example, the exchange offers over 100 different trading pairs including those with several fiat currencies as a base (USD, EUR, GBP, & JPY). As of April 28, 2019, the exchange‚Äôs self-reported 24-hour volume was $125,231,371 their 7-day volume $1,361,694,758, and their 30-day volume $6,610,518,589. Similar to its main competitors, the exchange offers a number of additional exchange products such as margin trading and algorithmic trading orders.\n\nThe below charts plot the trading volume for its BTC\u002FUSD pair over time compared to its major competitors measured in both BTC and USD.\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Ftether1-2.html\" width=\"90%\" height=\"330\" align=\"middle\" style=\"margin: 0 auto\"; frameBorder=\"0\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Ftesh.html\" width=\"90%\" height=\"330\" frameBorder=\"0\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\nOne can see that following the collapse of Mt. Gox (counted within the Others category below), Bitfinex has grown to occupy a rather large proportion of trading volume for the BTC\u002FUSD trading pair. The crypto asset market now is much more than just Bitcoin, but nevertheless, this data point alone helps show how large a player Bitfinex has generally been within the market.\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Ftether3.html\" width=\"90%\" height=\"420\" frameBorder=\"0\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n# Bitfinex and Tether\n\nIt can be argued that Tether has played an even more important role in crypto asset markets than Bitfinex due to its role as the de facto stable coin within the industry. Tether was founded by a group including Brock Pierce, Craig Sellars, and Reeve Collins in 2014 as one of the first ‚Äòstable coins‚Äô ‚Äì a crypto asset designed to maintain a peg to a popular fiat currency such as the US dollar by maintaining a 1:1 backing with dollars deposited by customers. The crypto asset was created through the use of the Omni Layer [Protocol](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.omnilayer.org\u002F). Tether‚Äôs relationship with Bitfinex is complicated but there is substantial evidence suggesting that the organizations share co-founders ‚Äì namely Phillip Potter and Giancarlo Devansini. [Documents](https:\u002F\u002Foffshoreleaks.icij.org\u002Fnodes\u002F82024464) released in the Paradise Papers supports this [thesis](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.nytimes.com\u002F2017\u002F11\u002F21\u002Ftechnology\u002Fbitcoin-bitfinex-tether.html).\n\nThe below chart plots the growth of Tether‚Äôs monetary base over time in order to better help explicate the sheer economic scale of Tether.\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Ftether4.html\" width=\"90%\" height=\"330\" frameBorder=\"0\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\nBy most measures, Tether is one of the most valuable (considering per unit price and total circulating supply) crypto assets and the current leader within the stable coin sector. Total reported exchange volume figures can help quantify the extent to which tether is used by investors and traders ‚Äì by most counts its exchange volume trails on that of Bitcoin.\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Ftether5.html\" width=\"90%\" height=\"330\" frameBorder=\"0\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\nThe metric of the utmost importance to judge the success of a stable coin is its ability to maintain stability over time. The chart below plots OHLC data for the USDT\u002FUSD pair on Bitfinex from late 2018:\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Ftether6.html\" width=\"90%\" height=\"300\" frameBorder=\"0\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\nTo put the above chart into even more context, it is helpful to compare Tether‚Äôs stability to that of its main competitors. Looking at the data it‚Äôs clear that the difference in stability (as measured by price return standard deviation) is minimal between the currently popular stable coins ‚Äì though this hasn‚Äôt always been the case if one chooses to include some of the historically less successful stable coins such as bitUSD within the analysis.\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Ftether7.html\" width=\"90%\" height=\"330\" frameBorder=\"0\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\nWhat this analysis should make clear is the dominant role Tether has carved out within the crypto asset space as the obvious choice for traders and investors looking for stability or for other users who are unable to easily access US dollars. It has only been in the last year that credible competitors to Tether have emerged aiming to supplant Tether by focusing on regulatory-compliance (USDC, GUSD, PAX, TUSD), audibility (USDC, GUSD, PAX, TUSD, DAI), and technological advancements (DAI). The reason why those features may be attractive to users should become obvious by the end of the next section.\n\n# Controversies\n\nBitfinex and Tether have, since early, been involved in a number of controversies which are worth noting before unpacking. Below we summarize the most significant:\n\nIn [May 2015](https:\u002F\u002Fcointelegraph.com\u002Fnews\u002Fbreaking-bitfinex-hot-wallet-hacked-bitcoins-stolen), 1,500 bitcoin were stolen from a Bitfinex hot wallet\n\nIn [June 2016](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.cftc.gov\u002FPressRoom\u002FPressReleases\u002Fpr7380-16), the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CTFC) ordered Bitfinex to pay a $75, 000 fine for offering illegal retail commodity transactions and failing to register as a futures commission merchant\n\nIn [August 2016](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.bbc.co.uk\u002Fnews\u002Ftechnology-37009319), 199, 657 bitcoin (worth at the time $65m) was stolen from Bitfinex. The loss was shared proportionally amongst all Bitfinex‚Äôs users and users received BFX tokens proportional to their personal losses which Bitfinex pledged to exchange at a later date for the adequate repayment by Bitfinex.\n\nIn [March 2017](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.docdroid.net\u002Fjx1WRHX\u002Fbitfinex-vs-wells-fargo.pdf), Wells Fargo cut off all services to Bitfinex and Tether. This action is subsequently followed by a [lawsuit](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.docdroid.net\u002Fjx1WRHX\u002Fbitfinex-vs-wells-fargo.pdf) against Well Fargo from Bitfinex ‚Äì which is later [withdrawn](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.docdroid.net\u002FXmoxNAe\u002Fdismissal.pdf).\n\nIn [August 2017](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.coindesk.com\u002Fbitfinex-suspends-sale-select-ico-tokens-citing-sec-concerns), Bitfinex announced it would no longer permit U.S.- based individual investors to access the trading platform.\n\nIn [November 2017,](https:\u002F\u002Farchive.fo\u002F0g0oR) 31 million USDT is hacked from the Tether treasury wallet. Tether subsequently hard forks to prevent the spending of those funds.\n\nIn [December 2017](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.bloomberg.com\u002Fnews\u002Farticles\u002F2018-01-30\u002Fcrypto-exchange-bitfinex-tether-said-to-get-subpoenaed-by-cftc), the CFTC sends subpoenas to Bitfinex and Tether.\n\nIn [June 2018](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.scribd.com\u002Fdocument\u002F382183392\u002FFSS-Account-Snapshot-Statement#from_embed), a memorandum prepared by law firm Freeh Sporkin & Sullivan, LLP claims that the value of Tether‚Äôs reserves equaled the value of circulating USDT.\n\nIn [October 2018](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.bloomberg.com\u002Fnews\u002Farticles\u002F2018-10-02\u002Fpuerto-rico-s-cryptocurrency-bank-noble-is-said-to-seek-sale), Tether and Bitfinex‚Äôs relationship with Puerto Rico-based Noble Bank comes to an end.\n\nIn [March 2019](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.theblockcrypto.com\u002Ftiny\u002Ftether-quietly-updates-its-collateral-breakdown-which-includes-cash-equivalents-and-third-party-loans\u002F), Tether changed its disclosure, to include that ‚Äú[elvery tether is always 100% backed by our reserves. which include traditional currency and cash equivalents and. from time to time. may include other assets and receivables from loans made by Tether to third parties, which may include affiliated entities (collectively. ‚Äòreserves‚Äô). ‚Äú\n\nAside from the aforementioned controversies, Tether and Bitfinex have constantly been plagued with accusations of Tether‚Äôs insolvency and claims of market manipulation ‚Äì most notable from the pseudonymous writer Bitfinex‚Äôed. The claims of Bitfinex‚Äôed have been followed up by analyses conducted by [Bloomberg](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.bloomberg.com\u002Fgraphics\u002F2018-tether-kraken-trades\u002F) and [academics from the University of Texas at Austin](https:\u002F\u002Fpapers.ssrn.com\u002Fsol3\u002Fpapers.cfm?abstract_id=3195066), both drawing suspicion to Tether and postulating its use as a possible means to manipulate the Bitcoin market.\n\n# The Investigation\n\nNow that sufficient context has been given to both Tether and Bitfinex, we can now turn our focus to the NYAG investigation and summarize its main findings. On [April 25, 2019](https:\u002F\u002Fag.ny.gov\u002Fpress-release\u002Fattorney-general-james-announces-court-order-against-crypto-currency-company-under), Attorney General Letitia James announced that her office had obtained a [court order](https:\u002F\u002Fag.ny.gov\u002Fsites\u002Fdefault\u002Ffiles\u002F2019.04.24_signed_order.pdf) enjoining iFinex Inc., operator of Bitfinex and Tether Limited ‚Äì the issuer behind ‚ÄòTether‚Äô, from further violations of New York law related to their ongoing activities believed to have defrauded New York investors. The key violation was the accusation that the operators of Bitfinex had engaged in a cover-up to hide the loss of $850 million dollars of client funds. The court order requires the iFinex to ‚Äòcease further dissipation of the U.S. dollar assets which back \\[Tether] while the Office‚Äôs investigation continues‚Äù. The court was issued under a provision of New York‚Äôs [Martin Act](https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FMartin_Act)  ‚Äì a New York‚Äôs anti-fraud law which grants expansive law enforcement powers allowing officials to conduct investigations of securities fraud and bring civil and\u002For criminal actions against violators of the Act. The key findings of NYAG‚Äôs investigation are as follows:\n\n**The Tether entities are owned and operated by the same group of executives and employees who operate Bitfinex.** Moreover, Tether is majority owned by an entity named DigFinex Inc. which is the majority owner of iFinex. This fact was widely thought to be the case but can be thoroughly confirmed with the NYAG investigation. **(1)** \n\nDespite Bitfinex‚Äôs August 2017 ban of U.S.-based individuals from accessing its trading platform, **the Office of the Attorney General (OAG) has reason to believe that Bitfinex sill allows New York-based investors to access their trading platform. (2)**\n\nOn November 27, 2018, the **OAG served subpoenas on both Bitfinex and Tether seeking documents and information** ‚Äì as previously reported but not yet confirmed. **(3)**\n\nIn 2014, Bitfinex began a relationship with a (believed to be) Panamanian entity called Crypto Capital Corp. to act as one of their ‚Äòpayment processors.‚Äù. **By 2018 Bitfinex had deposited over one billion dollars of client funds with Crypto Capital.** Importantly, no contract or written agreement was ever entered into between Crypto Capital and Bitfinex or Tether. **(4)**\n\nBy mid-2018, Bitfinex began encountering difficulty honoring its clients‚Äô requests to withdraw their money from its platform because **Crypto Capital ‚Äì which at this point held almost all of Bitfinex‚Äôs funds ‚Äì refused to process customer withdrawal request and refused to return any funds to Bitfinex.** Despite this, Bitfinex published two notices on October 7 & 15, 2018 to investors ensuring them that the company was not insolvent and that all cryptocurrency and fiat withdrawals are processing as usual. **(5)**\n\nAn individual at Crypto Capital told a senior Bitfinex executive (‚ÄúMerlin‚Äù) that **the reason that Bitfinex‚Äôs funds (which now totalled $851 million) could not be returned was that they had been seized by governmental authorities in Portugal, Poland, and the United States.** Respondents from Bitfinex do not believe Crypto Capital‚Äôs representations that the funds have been seized. As such **the $851 million of customer funds remains inaccessible to Bitfinex to date. (6)**\n\nOn February 21, 2019 **counsel for Bitfinex and Tether explained that they were in the process of contemplating a move wherein Bitfinex would take a line of credit of $600 to $700 million on the reserve funds backing tether to help make up for the apparent loss of $851 million to Crypto Capital.** The OAG raised serious concern over the viability of such a plan. **(7)**\n\nOn **March 29, 2019, OAG received a letter from the counsel for Bitfinex and Tether which disclosed that the line of credit transaction had already closed on March 27, 2019.** Moreover, the description of the terms of the transaction differed massively from what had already been described to the OAG. (8)\n\nIt was revealed that during November 2018, **Tether transferred $625 million held in its account at Deltec (their bank at the time) to Bitfinex‚Äôs account at Deltec.** Simultaneously, a ledger entry at Crypto Capital credited Tether‚Äôs account in the amount of $625 million and debited Bitfinex‚Äôs account by the same amount. **(9)**\n\nIn December 2018, **Bitfinex undertook negotiations with Tether on an agreement wherein Tether extended a** [**secured**](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.investopedia.com\u002Fask\u002Fanswers\u002F110614\u002Fwhats-difference-between-secured-line-credit-and-unsecured-line-credit.asp)**,** [**revolving**](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.investopedia.com\u002Fask\u002Fanswers\u002F110614\u002Fwhat-are-differences-between-revolving-credit-and-line-credit.asp) **\\*\\*[**line of credit**](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.investopedia.com\u002Fterms\u002Fl\u002Flineofcredit.asp)** of up to $900 million on a term of three years and a 6.5% interest rate on outstanding loans.\\*\\* The line of credit was secured by 60,000,000 iFinex Inc. shares owned by DigFinex. This transaction closed on March 19, 2019. In total, $700 million has been accessed under the loan facility as of April 25, 2019. (10)\n\nOn March 27, 2019, **Bitfinex and Tether began a transaction debiting $625 million which had previously been credited to Tether‚Äôs account at Crypto Capital and then consequently crediting Bitfinex‚Äôs account for the same amount.** This was done because the previous transaction (9) had been converted into a line of credit (10). **(11)**\n\n**Up until this point, the OAG believes that none of this information had been disclosed to investors in Tether or Bitfinex‚Äôs clients. (12)** \n\nThe purpose of the OAG‚Äôs **ongoing investigation is to determine the extent to which New York investors are exposed to ongoing fraud by Bitfinex and Tether. (13)** \n\nDocuments required from Tether and Bitfinex following the court order include among others: (i) All documents and information requested in the November 2019 Subpoenas and in the OAG‚Äôs letter to Tether and Bitfinex in February 2019; (ii) All documents concerning Bitfinex and Tether clients and business partners who reside or do business within New York; (iii) All documents concerning any transactions to extend the line of credit made between Tether and Bitfinex. **(14)**\n\nFinally, it is important to note that **the OAG does not seek to interfere with the operation of Bitfinex and Tether‚Äôs ‚Äúlegitimate business‚Äù nor limit their ability to further access or extend the line of credit in order to preserve the ‚Äústatus quo and protect the interests of New York tether holders and Bitfinex clients‚Äù. (15)**\n\nPerhaps the key takeaway from this investigation is that, as of today, the estimated 2, 846,831, 191 USDT are in-fact only backed by 2,146,831,191 US dollars (75%) at the most, with the rest backed by a loan secured by 60 million iFinex shares. Secondly, attention is drawn to the controversial bank, Crypto Capital, the ostensible reason why Bitfinex is unable to claim back its customers‚Äô funds. This is the same Crypto Capital who received the [blame](https:\u002F\u002Fbreakermag.com\u002Fcrypto-capital-is-the-common-thread-between-bitfinex-quadrigacx-and-other-troubled-exchanges\u002F) for QuadrigaCX‚Äôs withdrawal problems; moreover, Crypto Capital has been linked to a total of four exchanges which have had issues with fund withdrawals historically ‚Äì Bitfinex, QuadrigaCX, CEX.io, and Coinapult. Finally, it is important to note that the scope of the OAG‚Äôs investigation is limited to the extent to which Bitfinex and Tether defrauded residents and citizens of New York ‚Äì the magnitude of which may be argued to be much smaller than the full extent of their overall alleged fraud.\n\n# The Reaction\n\nUnderstandably so, the news of the NYAG investigation shook the crypto asset news cycle and impacted the markets. Interestingly enough, we have not seen a massive market downturn nor a catastrophic impact on USDT‚Äôs dollar parity. The data points which truly tell the story of the Bitfinex-Tether drama have been: the pricing of crypto assets on Bitfinex compared to its competitors, exchange on-chain in-\u002Fout-flows data, inter-stable coin pricing, and on-chain data for the minting of competitor stable coins.\n\n The charts below compare pricing on Bitfinex for the BTC\u002FUSD trading pair with that of Coinbase and Kraken. One can see that, once the news broke, Bitfinex‚Äôs trading pair has been consistently trading at a premium to that of its competitors as investors try to get their funds out of the exchange.\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Ftether8.html\" width=\"90%\" height=\"330\" frameBorder=\"0\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Ftether9.html\" width=\"90%\" height=\"330\" frameBorder=\"0\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\nAs of yesterday, the premium was as much as 3% when compared to the averages of Kraken and Coinbase Pro. This point becomes even more obvious when we begin to look at the Bitfinex‚Äôs on-chain inflows and outflows and how they have changed since the news broke. Below we plot the exchange net outflows for both ETH and BTC on Bitfinex\u003Csup\u003E1\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E.\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Ftether10.html\" width=\"90%\" height=\"330\" frameBorder=\"0\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Ftether11.html\" width=\"90%\" height=\"330\" frameBorder=\"0\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\nOn the day following the news breaking, the exchange experience unprecedented net outflows of both ETH and BTC from their wallets which supports the thesis that many Bitfinex customers have been hastily attempting to get their funds out of the exchange. Over $250 million worth of ETH and BTC left the exchange the day following the news of the OAG investigation and we can imagine considerable amounts of other crypto assets followed suit.\n\nFurthermore, we can get a better idea of the news‚Äô effect on Tether by considering what premium the market has placed on BTC\u002FUSDT trades when compared to competitor stable coins. We focus on stable coin trading on Binance with the exception of DAI since there is currently no BTC\u002FDAI trading pair on Binance.\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Ftether12.html\" width=\"90%\" height=\"330\" frameBorder=\"0\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\nAs expected, the BTC\u002FUSDT trading pair is priced at around a 100-unit premium to that of the other trading pairs. This is a strong signal that traders are trying to move their capital from USDT into BTC. It would follow from this data point, one would assume, that there has been an increase in demand for the competitor stable coins as well. The fundamental metric to ascertain this is the number of new stable coins which have been issued since the April 25th announcement.\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Ftether13-1.html\" width=\"90%\" height=\"330\" frameBorder=\"0\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\nThe spike in issuances amongst three of the most popular stable coins (PAX, TUSD, USDC) is noticeable and the highest it has been in the last two months. However, interestingly both GUSD and DAI did not experience significant spikes in new stable coin issuances ‚Äì likely in DAI‚Äôs case, due to the slightly more complicated mechanism involved in the issuance process. It is difficult to draw conclusions from only a few days worth of data but everything suggests that the news has led to investors start to withdraw their crypto assets from both Tether and Bitfinex. Moreover, there has been a noticeable increase in interest for the main Tether competitors but it remains to be seen if this change in trend will make any significant difference to Tether‚Äôs dominance within the stable coin market.\n\n# Outcomes\n\nThis report has helped demonstrate how important the OAG‚Äôs investigation is and it should now be easy to imagine what negative effects this could have on Bitfinex and Tether. A more interesting question is to consider what effects this report and its findings will have on the wider crypto asset market.\n\nAs we have previously mentioned, Tether is one of the industry‚Äôs most widely-used crypto assets and there is the potential that the findings of the NYAG‚Äôs investigation could **damage the market‚Äôs belief in USDT‚Äôs parity with the dollar ‚Äì and for good reason**. Currently, for each outstanding USDT, only around 75¬¢ are currently held by Tether with the 25¬¢ being ‚Äòbacked‚Äô by illiquid debt ‚Äì in turn, collateralized by an illiquid security (the 60,000,000 shares in DigFinex). As a result of this fact, Tether is currently unable to honor all redemptions for outstanding USDT. Given this fact we can expect to the market to begin to price USDT at a steep discount to the dollar; alternatively, if this doesn‚Äôt happen exchanges where USDT continues to trade at odds with reality expose themselves to a large amount of risk and the whole industry to contagion risk as a result.\n\nGiven the fact that USDT is still priced relatively close to parity with the dollar, it would not be surprising if certain exchanges with viable stable coin alternatives considered de-listing USDT. This remains a possibility but is perhaps relatively unlikely for now. Moreover, aside from the problem of USDT‚Äôs backing, Bitfinex still faces the possibility of criminal and\u002For civil charges from the NYAG during the concluding stages of the investigation. It‚Äôs outside of the scope of the research article to speculate on the legal outcomes of the investigation, however.\n\nAs we have shown, there has been a cloud of suspicions following Bitfinex and Tether for the last few years, this investigation could act as the impetus behind the market moving towards better regulated and trustworthy stable coins, as well as exchanges being held to higher standards. Such a move would be in the industry‚Äôs long-term best interests but the fall out in the short-term for an industry, which is somewhat dependent on Tether and Bitfinex, could be somewhat damaging.\n\nA consistent theme in the stories of trouble exchanges seems to be the Panama-based Crypto Capital which, as previously mentioned, has in the past provided banking for QuadrigaCX, Bitfinex, CEX.io, and Coinapult. The OAG investigation supports the case that the bank is functionally insolvent despite having relationships with several important crypto asset exchanges. The thesis that Bitfinex‚Äôs historical withdrawal problems have solely been a function of their failed banking relationships is more appealing and realistic than the [claims](https:\u002F\u002Fhackernoon.com\u002Fthe-curious-tale-of-tethers-6b0031eead87?source=---------21------------------) of wash trading which came to promise over the last two years.

There are a host of questions to be answered and we expect more to become clear as the market continues to react to the news, and the OAG‚Äôs investigation continues to bring to light more information about Tether and Bitfinex‚Äôs operations.\n\n‚Äî‚Äì\n\n1.

Token burning is the process by which a given amount of a crypto asset is permanently removed from the circulating supply in order to decrease the overall supply of that particular crypto asset. This process is often marketed as equivalent to fee- or profit sharing, dividend distributions, or stock repurchasing; however, this research note will argue that token burns have distinct differences which impact the extent to which they can be considered a value proposition for a given crypto asset. We focus on examples of token burning where the most data is available ‚Äì Binance Coin (BNB), Bibox Token (BIX), KuCoin (KCS) and Maker (MKR). Throughout this research note, we focus on the US dollar value of the token burn on the day at which the burn occurred to account for price fluctuations of the underlying crypto asset.\n\n# Exchange Tokens ‚Äì BNB, BIX, & KCS\n\nThe exchange tokens ‚Äì BNB, BIX, and KCS ‚Äì offer the best data sample to compare token burns between crypto assets. All three assets use token burns as a means of ostensibly transferring value from the exchange to the token holders ‚Äì we will go into the specifics later in this section. Below, we plot the burn amounts of the tokens over time and indicate their US dollar value:\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Fburn1.html\" width=\"90%\" height=\"550\" frameBorder=\"0\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\nThe burn mechanism generally acts as the primary value accrual method for the crypto assets; as such, we introduce the Price to Burn ratio as a metric to compare the value the market attaches to the mechanism on a per unit basis. The Price to Burn ratio is calculated as the crypto asset‚Äôs market capitalization divided by the cumulative number of tokens burned. Below, we plot the ratio from the start of 2019:\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Fburn2.html\" width=\"90%\" height=\"550\" frameBorder=\"0\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\nThe ratio demonstrates the premium that investors are paying for the number of tokens burned; for example, the fact that BIX‚Äôs ratio is more than half of BNB‚Äôs is an indicator that ‚Äì solely based off the crypto assets‚Äô burn function ‚Äì the latter is overvalued to the former. It should be noted however that such an analysis ignores the many other value propositions a given crypto asset could have or even the differences in their implementation of the burn mechanism.\n\nThe data below outlines the features of each crypto asset‚Äôs burn mechanism:\n\n**Binance Coin (BNB**) ‚Äî 20% of net profit. Continues until 100MM BNB are burned (50% of total supply).\t\n\n**Bibox Token (BIX)** ‚Äî 25% of net profit. Continues until 300MM BIX are burned (60% of total supply).\t\n\n**KuCoin Shares (KCS)** ‚Äî 10% of net profit. Continues until 100MM KCS are burned (50% of total supply).\n\n**Maker ‚Äì MKR**\n\nMaker (MKR) is another good example of a crypto asset with a burn mechanism. In this system, those who create loans using the Maker credit facility must pay a fee (the ‚Äústability fee‚Äù) which is then used to buy MKR and burned\\[i]. The chart below plots the total amount of MKR burned over time since the launch of the credit facility in December 2017. Note that these figures do not include liquidation penalties which are currently used to burn Pooled ETH (PETH) and not MKR.\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Fburn3.html\" width=\"90%\" height=\"550\" frameBorder=\"0\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\nMoreover, we plot the Price to Burn ratio for Maker.\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Fburn4.html\" width=\"90%\" height=\"550\" frameBorder=\"0\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\nOne thing that should be noted is the large premium (as measured through the Price to Burn Ratio) the market seems to be valuing Maker at compared to the exchange tokens. For example, Maker‚Äôs ratio has generally hovered between 600 and 1200 compared to 10 and 90 for the exchange tokens. The key reason for this is due to Maker‚Äôs price being less a function of its current accrued stability fee but, rather, future expectations of accrued stability fees. While in an exchange token like BNB‚Äôs case, its mechanism means that (1) large amounts of tokens are currently being burned and their ostensible effect has already been priced in, and (2) the upper bound of the total amount of crypto assets available to be burned may place an upper bound on the Price to Burn Ratio.\n\n# Token Burns and Valuation\n\nThose within the industry have often compared token burns to stock repurchases but we believe such a comparison is weak. The limits of this comparison have been picked up on by those within the industry such as Spencer Bogart of Blockchain Capital:\n\nThe value of a stock repurchase is its ability to increase the cash each unit of stock is entitled to which, under a discounted cash flow valuation method, will increase the value of said stock, other things being equal. This logic does not hold for token burns as, even though the token burn does, in fact, reduce the crypto asset‚Äôs circulating supply, these tokens offer no claim on another cash flow upon which to predicate a discounted cash flow valuation.\n\nThis fact, however, does not mean that token burns cannot be seen as value accrual mechanisms. In cases where the token burn relies on an auction process wherein units of the crypto asset are bought from the open market and then burned, it is possible to theorize upon reasons why such a mechanism should impact the valuation of the crypto asset. Such a theory though would rely on a constant and automated process for the purchasing and burning of the crypto asset from the open market. We can theorize that in such circumstances an arbitrage pricing argument would suffice to explain why a crypto asset could be valued at a given price assuming the existence of the aforementioned constant and automated buyback and burn mechanism. In the case of the exchange tokens, it is likely that their burn mechanism does not rely on open market buybacks but rather the burn of the crypto asset‚Äôs supply already held by the exchange. It is unclear in such a case why this mechanism should necessarily lead to the accrual of value to the given crypto asset.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThis research note has explicated the concept of token burns and demonstrated several crypto assets which have implemented the mechanism ‚Äì BNB, KCS, BIX, and Maker. We demonstrate how the exact implementation of the mechanism affects its impact on value accrual. Notably, we argue how it is fallacious to consider token burns analogous to stock repurchases due to the lack of intrinsic cash flow in the former‚Äôs case. Instead, a promising valuation methodology for buy back and burn crypto assets could be formulated on the back of an arbitrage pricing argument ‚Äì however, it relies on a mechanism wherein units of the crypto asset are automatically bought from the open market and then burned.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThe information provided does not constitute a prospectus or other offering material and does not contain or constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of any offer to buy securities in any jurisdiction.\n\nSome of the information published herein may contain forward-looking statements.

This research note does not aim to fully explain exactly how Uniswap works because there have already been a number of good explanatory articles [written](https:\u002F\u002Fmedium.com\u002Fscalar-capital\u002Funiswap-a-unique-exchange-f4ef44f807bf) about it which we recommend the reader looks at. This note ‚Äì split into two articles ‚Äì will look at two key agents within the Uniswap economy and analyze the relevant data for each to ascertain the viability of the Uniswap AMM model.\n\n# Key Agents\n\nThe agents are as follows:\n\n**Traders** who can submit orders to buy X amount of ETH and must pay Y amount of a given token as decided by the AMM or vice versa. In general, a trader aims to get the best available price for their trade (less fees) ‚Äì defined as the lowest possible value of Y\u002FX for a given order size when compared to alternative exchanges.\n\n**Liquidity Providers** who provide liquidity for a given trading pair which the AMM then uses. For this, they are rewarded a proportional share of the 0.3% fee taken on trades carried out on Uniswap. In general, a liquidity provider aims to maximize their returns which is measured as the increase in terms of dollar value of their proportion of the liquidity pool ‚Äì which is a function of: (1) the liquidity they committed (in tokens X & Y) as a proportion of total liquidity of the trading pair; (2) the dollar value of tokens X & Y each over time; and (3) the amount of fees they receive from those who use the given liquidity pool.\n\n# Trades\n\nIn order to ascertain whether traders, on average, received the best available price on Uniswap, we narrowed in on a specific trading pair ‚Äì ETH\u002FDAI. The below chart shows the derived exchange rate (on a trade-by-trade basis) for ETH\u002FDAI and DAI\u002FETH trading pairs over time:\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Funiswap1.html\" width=\"90%\" height=\"350\" frameBorder=\"0\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\nAs expected, the ETH and DAI prices have an (almost perfectly) inverse relationship over time. This fact is not surprising given that it can be said to be a corollary of the function of the AMM.Compare this instead to the trading pairs for ETH & DAI on another popular order-booked based exchange called EtherDelta. The below chart shows the price of the ETH\u002FDAI & DAI\u002FETH trading pairs on EtherDelta:\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Funiswap2.html\" width=\"90%\" height=\"350\" frameBorder=\"0\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\nThere is a stark difference in price stability and liquidity in EtherDelta when compared to Uniswap.  This can potentially be put down to the effectiveness of the AMM thus far when judged solely on those two aforementioned factors. However, there are a few caveats to this kind of analysis: (1) liquidity on EtherDelta is generally quite low for ETH & DAI trading pairs; and (2) if one is trying to make an argument for the AMM‚Äôs ability to provide traders with good prices it makes more sense to compare Uniswap to the most popular decentralized exchanges. Thus, the chart shown below compares trading volume across the most popular decentralized exchanges (or relayers) since shortly after Uniswap‚Äôs launch to mid-March (2018-11-14 to 2019-03-14):\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Funiswap3.html\" width=\"90%\" height=\"350\" frameBorder=\"0\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n# Analysis\n\nAs the above chart shows, Uniswap‚Äôs trading volume for most of the timeframe paled in comparison to some of the more popular decentralized exchanges such as Paradex, Radar Relay, and Kyber (as well as DDEX). This can be mostly explained by the exchange‚Äôs youth, as well as the nature of the use of a Constant Product AMM where the possibility of a ‚Äòbest price‚Äô gets worse as the volume of the trade increases. This fact disincentivizes large trades (as a proportion of the liquidity pool) from happening, although this fact isn‚Äôt necessarily important given Uniswap‚Äôs ostensible niche as a user-friendly decentralized broker-dealer service.\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Funiswap4.html\" width=\"90%\" height=\"350\" frameBorder=\"0\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\nMoreover, all exchanges looked at for this analysis show surprisingly small (non-weighted) average price intergroup variance which demonstrates that arbitrageur behaviour on DEXs has been relatively efficient despite potential issues with their early-stage infrastructure. Plotting the volume-weighted average prices (VWAP) of these DEXs, however, paints a slightly different picture:\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Funiswap5.html\" width=\"90%\" height=\"350\" frameBorder=\"0\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\nAs can be seen, the daily VWAP of Uniswap is more responsive to changes in price than the other DEXs; this is expected as large quantity orders (which the VWAP metric gives more weight to than a na√Øve average price calculation) receive a worse exchange rate than on other exchanges with similar liquidity. This fact extenuates price shocks as measured by VWAP.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThis article has served as a brief commentary on the exchange data behind Uniswap to help readers better understand how the exchange‚Äôs mechanics affect traders. This commentary series will continue next week with a look at the data behind Uniswap‚Äôs liquidity provision (the second key agent).\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThe information provided does not constitute a prospectus or other offering material and does not contain or constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of any offer to buy securities in any jurisdiction.\n\nSome of the information published herein may contain forward-looking statements.

It, along with a crypto asset‚Äôs per unit price, allows investors to better understand the relative valuation of different assets. However, the metric has been mired in controversy due to the difficulty, in some cases, of determining an accurate measure of it ‚Äì this has been a particular problem for crypto assets like XRP and Bitcoin Private. This report will break down the circulating supply metric and then explain its implications with reference to XRP and the metric-related issues it has faced.\n\n# Circulating Supply Explanation\n\nThe primary utility of the circulating supply metric comes from its ability to help investors calculate the ‚Äúmarket capitalization‚Äù of a crypto asset, that is, its total supply multiplied by its price. For stocks, the market capitalization measures the total value of a company and the same generally holds for crypto assets. The issue is that, whilst in traditional finance the float ‚Äì the number of outstanding units available for trade on the market accounting for locked-up shares held by company employees and investors ‚Äì can be calculated in a pre-defined way and restrictions on unit lock up are enforced by law, the same does not exist for crypto assets. While there is promise of smart contracts enforcing vesting periods in the same way legal guidelines do, this practice is not yet widespread.\n\nCirculating supply can be defined as the total amount of crypto asset units in existence which: is not subject to any programmatic or contractual restrictions or lock-ups; is visible on the crypto asset‚Äôs public ledger; and excludes project, foundation or founder units which have not yet been sold\u003Csup\u003Ei\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E.\n\nLet‚Äôs begin with two working examples of the circulating supply metric: Bitcoin and Ethereum. We can break down the differences in the two crypto assets‚Äô circulating supply schedules by appealing to Messari‚Äôs demarcation of the metric‚Äôs five inputs\u003Csup\u003Eii\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E:\n\n* Token Generation ‚Äì (i) Initial Generated Supply, and (ii) Maximum Supply\n* Programmatic Inflation ‚Äì (i) Defined Inflation Policy & Forecast, and (ii) Method for Amending Inflation Policy & Forecast Changes\n* Programmatic Deflation ‚Äì (i) Loss Estimates, and (ii) Burn Policy\n* Founders‚Äô Supply (Company & Individuals) ‚Äì (i) Liquid, (ii) Vesting\u002FEscrow Policy, and (iii) Secondary Sale Policy\n* Community Supply (Investors\u002FPartners\u002FThird Parties) ‚Äì (i) Liquid, (ii) Vesting\u002FEscrow Policy, and (iii) Secondary Sale Policy\n\n_Bitcoin_\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Fxrp1-1.html\" width=\"90%\" height=\"320\" frameBorder=\"0\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\nThis chart shows Bitcoin‚Äôs circulating supply since its inception. The relevant input for Bitcoin‚Äôs circulating supply is **Programmatic Inflation**. All bitcoin that have been created and will ever exist were produced through a block reward on a pre-defined inflation schedule. Moreover, the **Token Generation** input would solely define the inflation parameters decided upon during the Genesis block, such as the supply cap limit of 21 million.\n\n_Ethereum_\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Fxrp2-1.html\" width=\"90%\" height=\"300\" frameBorder=\"0\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\nThis chart shows Ethereum‚Äôs circulating supply since its inception; in this case the supply spikes up to around 60 million ETH following the distribution to those who took part in the crowdsale and then another spike to 72 million ETH following the creation of the Ethereum development fund. Unlike Bitcoin, around 72 million ETH were created at the genesis block and distributed to stakeholders other than miners ‚Äì in this case, those who had contributed to the Ethereum crowdsale and those who had helped build the crypto asset. This relevant input is **Token Generation**. Moreover, Ethereum has a block reward which gives its circulating supply the second input of **Programmatic Inflation**.\n\n Other crypto assets have different mixes of the other circulating supply inputs. For example, Binance Coin (BNB) carries out quarterly ‚Äòburns‚Äô of the BNB token, therefore, reducing its overall supply. This input would be counted as **Programmatic Deflation**. Moreover, a crypto asset like 0x Project (ZRX) had a pre-defined vesting schedule for its founders which would count as the **Founders‚Äô Supply** input.\n\n# XRP Case Study\n\nNo crypto asset highlights some of the issues with accurate circulating supply calculations better than XRP. Over the last year, two reports by [Messari](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.scribd.com\u002Fdocument\u002F398154356\u002FRipple-s-Market-Cap-Is-Likely-Overstated-by-6-1-Billion-Summary#fullscreen&from_embed) and [Coin Metrics](https:\u002F\u002Fcoinmetrics.io\u002Fan-on-chain-analysis-of-ripples-escrow-system\u002F) have called into question Ripple Labs‚Äô reported value for XRP‚Äôs circulating supply.\n\nThe [Messari Report](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.scribd.com\u002Fdocument\u002F398154356\u002FRipple-s-Market-Cap-Is-Likely-Overstated-by-6-1-Billion-Summary#fullscreen&from_embed) argued that XRP‚Äôs circulating supply ‚Äì and consequently market cap ‚Äì could be overstated by 46% due to Ripple failing to account for, at the very least, the 6.7 billion of locked-up XRP of its co-founder, Jed McCaleb, the illiquid 5.9 billion XRP worth of donations publicly committed by co-founder Chris Larsen to RippleWorks, and the 4.1 billion XRP sold via the company‚Äôs money services business, XRP II, since 2016, which may be subject to re-selling restrictions. Messari argued that these illiquid positions of XRP equal 19.2 billion worth of XRP ‚Äì which is 46% of the 41 billion XRP quoted as ‚Äúin circulation‚Äù at the time of the report‚Äôs publication.\n\nThe pie chart below shows the XRP supply breakdown as reported by Ripple Labs:\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Fxrp4-1.html\" width=\"90%\" height=\"175\" frameBorder=\"0\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\nConversely, the pie chart below shows the XRP supply breakdown as estimated by Messari:\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Fxrp5-1.html\" width=\"90%\" height=\"175\" frameBorder=\"0\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\nMisrepresentations of a crypto asset‚Äôs circulating supply can have large effects on its popularity and use within other financial products such as market capitalization-weighted indexes and their associated products. It is understandable, therefore, why claims such as those made by Messari present risks to XRP‚Äôs current place within the market.\n\nMore recently, Coin Metrics released a [report](https:\u002F\u002Fcoinmetrics.io\u002Fan-on-chain-analysis-of-ripples-escrow-system\u002F) where they conducted on-chain analysis on Ripple‚Äôs escrow system ‚Äì the process by which XRP owned by Ripple Labs is placed into a ‚Äúcryptographically-secured escrow account‚Äù. The research noticed several discrepancies between what was publicly reported by Ripple Labs and what was actually visible on the XRP ledger. Issues to be taken into account include:\n\n* First, two of Ripple Labs‚Äô quarterly reports underrepresented the number of XRP released from escrow by a total of 200 million XRP.\n* Second, the escrow mechanism was implemented differently from what was publicly announced, which has led to XRP being released faster than implied by the release schedule.\n* Third, other parties potentially associated with Ripple have released 55 million XRP from a previously-unknown escrow address not connected to the main Ripple escrow account.\n\nThe chart below highlights the discrepancies between the on-chain amounts released from (and returned to) Ripple‚Äôs escrow compared to the reported amounts.\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ciframe src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fimg\u002Fuploads\u002Fxrp6-1.html\" width=\"90%\" height=\"325\" frameBorder=\"0\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\nThe differences in the values would have an effect on XRP‚Äôs true circulating supply. For example, in Q1 2019, XRP‚Äôs circulating supply would have been understated by at least 200 million XRP.\n\nRipple‚Äôs CTO, Joel Katz, has since [replied](https:\u002F\u002Ft.co\u002FNHYi4b19kf) to the Coin Metrics report, explaining the discrepancies as a result of ‚Äútimeline issues‚Äù. Whether or not his explanation is sufficiently convincing, however, does not change the fact that these issues are of the utmost importance.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nOur research focused on XRP since it has been subject to the most controversy in relation to its reported circulating supply figures, but this issue exists for many other crypto assets, especially those which claim to hold their founders to vesting schedules. While there will continue to be issues of this nature going forward, we believe that as regulators begin to play a more active role within the space and as data analysts and researchers continue to hold crypto asset organizations to account over their reporting, the industry will move to more systematic measures of key metrics such as circulating supply.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThe information provided does not constitute a prospectus or other offering material and does not contain or constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of any offer to buy securities in any jurisdiction.\n\nSome of the information published herein may contain forward-looking statements.

In this new piece, for informational purposes only, at 21Shares, we dive into the main valuation methods to evaluate Bitcoin. ",content:"On Wednesday, March, 3rd ‚Äî Swissquote, Switzerland's leading provider of online financial and trading services, hosted a webinar session with the 21Shares team on how to value Bitcoin in the short term as well as the long term in front of 300+ participants.\n\nIn a nutshell, this panel was organized to answer these questions:\n\n1. What are the metrics which we should use to track short-term Bitcoins price movements to assess investor sentiment?\n2. And what are the frameworks that best indicate and prove long-term value investing signals for market participants?\n\nYou can watch the full episode [here](https:\u002F\u002F21shares.com\u002Fresearch\u002Fhow-to-value-bitcoin-short-term-long-term\u002F).\n\nThis article will zero in on the second question ‚Äîvaluing bitcoin in the long term and we'll dive into three main valuation methods for Bitcoin that we find intuitive.\n\n* Market Sizing\n* The NUPL ratio standing for Net Unrealized Profit and Loss\n* The Technology adoption lifecycle of Bitcoin\n* And we'll leave a final word on the potential price appreciation of Bitcoin in this cycle\n\n### Important to note that this is a non-exhaustive list of valuation frameworks.\n\nThere are other key elements to consider such as strong [network security](https:\u002F\u002Fbtc.com\u002Fstats\u002Fdiff) and decentralization preventing attacks, and the growing use of [renewable energy sources](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.coindesk.com\u002Fthe-last-word-on-bitcoins-energy-consumption) for mining Bitcoin just to name a few.\n\n## Market Sizing\n\nIt's been documented and established that Bitcoin shares many characteristics of gold and for this reason, Bitcoin is usually described as digital gold. As such, by relying on the market-sizing method, we can get an estimation of the total addressable market ([TAM)](https:\u002F\u002Fblog.hubspot.com\u002Fmarketing\u002Ftotal-addressable-market) for Bitcoin, which in this specific case is the market capitalization of gold [valued](https:\u002F\u002F8marketcap.com\u002Fmetals\u002F) at approximately $10 trillion dollars.\n\nIn theory, if Bitcoin reaches the market value of gold, the price per bitcoin will be more than $500,000. To be more specific, by dividing the market cap of gold by the outstanding number of bitcoins ever created ‚Äî hence 10 trillion divided by 18.6 million, we get a Bitcoin price of roughly $535,000.\n\n![No alt text provided for this image](https:\u002F\u002Flh3.googleusercontent.com\u002F8ibYzxJ70181ZMKNB6n9_hn54jJ1MkCoBOg6_pgvnwdtjdHVQ03LMntwpYNFPthah12oRcGi-2O3LYccOlr5M7CwG8zVrW2rt82m-kB8Y6A8ss4EJ8tDE4AiOPNVFpcgfVmAuEsS)\n\nAt 21Shares we believe that Bitcoin has the chance to exceed the market value of gold. In fact, Bitcoin is a digital native asset, accessible anywhere in the world with an internet connection. The asset has a fixed, predictable supply of 21 million units ending in approximately 119 years, which since inception is programmatically-declining every four years (ie, the halving). More importantly, in the context of social distancing, closed borders, and fear of virus transmission ‚Äî unlike gold, Bitcoin is easily transferable like emails and billions of dollars worth of BItcoin could be stored in a USB key also called storage in the industry (though as a [rule of thumb](https:\u002F\u002Fmedium.com\u002F@nic__carter\u002Fits-the-settlement-assurances-stupid-5dcd1c3f4e41), it‚Äôs recommended to wait an hour or roughly six blocks, added to the blockchain roughly every 10 minutes, to make sure a transaction is confirmed). Finally, the Bitcoin blockchain is tamper-resistant, open-source, and can be verified by anyone, give it a look [here](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.blockchain.com\u002Fexplorer).\n\nAll the aforementioned points make the case as to why Bitcoin is better than gold. Note this analysis does not take into account the incredible innovations atop of Bitcoin such as the [Lightning Network](https:\u002F\u002Flightning.network\u002F) and [Stacks](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.stacks.co\u002F), which could expand the potential total addressable market by orders of magnitude and also the use cases [documented](https:\u002F\u002Freason.com\u002Fvideo\u002F2021\u002F02\u002F05\u002Fbitcoin-is-protecting-human-rights-around-the-world\u002F) by the Human Rights Foundation, proving that Bitcoin serves as an alternative and censorship-resistant monetary system to protect human rights.\n\nGold unlike Bitcoin is shiny and benefits from the test of time with thousands of years under its belt. Also, gold has significantly more liquidity and is less volatile than the cryptoasset due to the fact Bitcoin is an emerging store of value that has increased by more than 5 billion percent ever since. For the record, the [first-ever](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.reuters.com\u002Farticle\u002Fus-crypto-currencies-bitcoin-factbox-idUSKCN1N50GE) exchange rate recorded was about $0.0009 per Bitcoin by Martti Malmi, an early Bitcoin developer, who transferred $5.02 for 5,050 BTC via PayPal to seed a then bitcoin exchange called New Liberty Standard.\n\n![No alt text provided for this image](https:\u002F\u002Flh3.googleusercontent.com\u002FuuVfYi2uLBdG-nS18DyRqUbV-UcsZI_rKUdxDIhjDhnTde2rF1nPyhtnOCma16IZhjbQr0QgMoWzGUzI_wubmS_6TynL0j8znkYziIxnpe17IwVQ6FrN312CoyTMSD1n0fTBqDLx)\n\n## Net Unrealized Profit And Loss (NUPL)\n\nNow let‚Äôs delve into the second valuation framework, the NUPL ratio standing for Net Unrealized Profit and Loss. The beauty of the blockchain as we covered in the market-sizing section is the fact that it's an open-source ledger, though transactions are pseudonymous, timestamps and transaction values are visible and humanly readable. As such, this certainly helps shed light on the potential psychology of bitcoin investors based on their P&L and as mentioned in a book authored by Morgan Housel, called The Psychology of Money, \"investing is not the study of finance. It‚Äôs the study of how people behave with money.\"\n\nThe NUPL ratio, in simple terms, measures the P&L of bitcoin investors and this metric has been instrumental to evaluate investor sentiment and identify the tops and bottoms for the price of Bitcoin over the past decade. To begin, market capitalization is an imperfect metric to measure how investors individually value bitcoin as they have different time horizons to sell the asset. So here comes [realized capitalization](https:\u002F\u002Fcoinmetrics.io\u002Frealized-capitalization\u002F) ‚Äî inspired by Pierre Rochard and created in late 2018 by Nic Carter and Antoine Le Calvez, which is the aggregate cost basis of each bitcoin not yet sold. Using the vocabulary of the crypto industry, this is the aggregate value of all unspent transaction outputs (UTOXs) priced by their value when they last moved.\n\nIn fact, not all bitcoins have the same cost basis. To give you an example, 2 Bitcoins allocated to a wallet sometime in January 2017 will have a cost basis of about $1,000 each as Bitcoin traded at that price, so a total value of $2,000. As such, the formula of the NUPL ratio is the following: realized cap minus market cap divided by market cap. The ratio ranges between 1 for 100% of the investors in profit and the negative territory for the losses.\n\nRemember, investing is also the study of how people behave with money. Depending on whether we are in a bull market or a bear market, the level of the NUPL ratio categorizes investor sentiment in 5 brackets as you can see at the bottom of this chart: capitulation in red, hope or fear in orange, optimism or anxiety in yellow, belief or denial in green and euphoria or greed in blue. Let me give you a concrete example.\n\n![No alt text provided for this image](https:\u002F\u002Flh5.googleusercontent.com\u002FkBOx2MnbMF6CthSCWdTYj2ObSbYfJcY4OXr5-ZE75i-izLWrH0ZZS5_LAHnyoHVB4sZPvVvRp5wsNsFunU-ekBP_D4yD5zKBJ8_gUn4tUiyO44QkSqyXrMaZkXkeMe8uYrVufnF1)\n\nLast year in mid-March there was a market crash due to the pandemic, the price of Bitcoin nosedived from the high $7,000 down to $4,000. A week later, the price jumped to over $6,000.\n\nBy investigating the bitcoin blockchain as you can see on the chart below when the price of bitcoin dropped, the coins shifted hands from short-term traders that bought Bitcoin less than 6 months ago at that time to long-term investors that held bitcoin for more than a year. And this explained the rapid recovery back to previous levels. To use the analogy of the NUPL ratio, when short-term traders capitulated and closed their positions, long-term investors found hope to buy bitcoin at a discounted price.\n\n![No alt text provided for this image](https:\u002F\u002Flh6.googleusercontent.com\u002FgYRbpVLoED_qCLtC-NQ_RYBJpWRBGMk5RGNiBTpR_vCNd7oGb9vO_8JLauy1KGtBAKhYH0S6RbuOhqADP_stBILy1oAWvOFGYJpWzX05JJQvz1qnbgVocuACBWnP1qqYrhbuiYyx)\n\n## The Technology Adoption Lifecycle\n\nNow let's dive into the last valuation method: the technology adoption lifecycle. With this one, we want to show you why we are still in the early innings of crypto adoption.\n\nFirst, let's answer this question \"how many people own cryptoassets?\". According to the University of Cambridge, there are more than [100 million](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.jbs.cam.ac.uk\u002Ffaculty-research\u002Fcentres\u002Falternative-finance\u002Fpublications\u002F2nd-global-cryptoasset-benchmark-study\u002F) crypto users. This is 2.5% of the entire internet population of 4.6 billion people, the reason we refer to the internet population as a realistic total addressable market, in this case, is that anyone needs an internet connection for accessing cryptoassets.\n\n![No alt text provided for this image](https:\u002F\u002Flh3.googleusercontent.com\u002FmBqE3gwGkqqH3d6h1_-5wwu4iEXuKw4oX4dX0yU9z2VOP1eV3KX34Xb-8OGWweFvKjKUiu4hKWoXU4GnTEkt2TFQAQyK6nsKo_r7qi1d5OFm-qwCsB3M-7M9VJLOl30q-xAzl1Wl)\n\nFor those new to the concept, the technology adoption lifecycle is a sociological model describing the acceptance of an innovation. The process over time looks like a bell curve as you can see below. This method categorizes different cohorts adopting a product or a service based on demographic and psychological attributes. It indicates that the first group of people to use a new product is called \"innovators\" followed by \"early adopters\". And then the early majority and late majority, and the last group to eventually adopt an innovation are called \"Laggards\".\n\nBack to the context of cryptoassets, 2.5% of the entire internet population means that we have not crossed the chasm for mainstream adoption yet. In fact, we are still in the innovator stage. But, the appeal to the crypto industry is significant, especially coming from conventional finance, a few leaders have been both brave and ahead of the adoption curve ‚Äî such as [Paul Tudor Jones](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.bloomberg.com\u002Fnews\u002Farticles\u002F2020-05-07\u002Fpaul-tudor-jones-buys-bitcoin-says-he-s-reminded-of-gold-in-70s), [Ruffer](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.coindesk.com\u002Fruffer-turns-bitcoin-investment-into-750m-profit-in-under-2-months), and the [endowments](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.coindesk.com\u002Fharvard-yale-brown-endowments-have-been-buying-bitcoin-for-at-least-a-year-sources) of Yale and Harvard University.\n\n![No alt text provided for this image](https:\u002F\u002Flh3.googleusercontent.com\u002F3kl6pr01WxbtPpfQnhatGyhVhGFjnSi7SmKBmNk8-NMEeXsmRGHh4hNy0STM39DQ7aiG7vGSmW6V2aejCsqGjsfht9XohiDP5PD9bfjRu7J0JIou_VG6vuDSJyGk_k_UdYErQdtU)\n\n12 years since the creation of bitcoin and a lot of people think that this is too late, but now you understand that this is just the beginning of the adoption lifecycle. To put things in perspective to compare with other technological advancements, in 1997, the Internet had roughly 100 million users, which is the equivalent of 2021 for the crypto industry.\n\n![No alt text provided for this image](https:\u002F\u002Flh5.googleusercontent.com\u002FtPp4Xlrug5YG9Kiev4ErCBMwNmObR00WhYLi8nr8niOE197EEjeDVyKb3sbo3raSz0lhCUdKS6_ck8WM9DX72-IuweaVZtEW5CrzmoaGPF_aKSqXWaECNnWGJIbfAYNWQtEz6tg2)\n\nSource: right-hand side slide, SkyBridge\n\nThe last point on the adoption lifecycle is regarding wealth management, according to a [survey](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.knightfrank.com\u002Fwealthreport\u002Fglobal-wealth\u002F2020-03-03-tracking-the-changing-attitudes-towards-wealth-around-the-world) composed of 620 private bankers and financial advisors who manage more than US$3 trillion of private client wealth, as much as 1% of the portfolio of high net worth individuals was invested in crypto assets. This is not as much as gold standing at 3%, which we believe bitcoin could exceed in the long run. Bear in mind that wealth management is a gigantic market [estimated](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.bcg.com\u002Fpress\u002F19may2020-global-asset-management-2020) at $89 trillion of global assets under management according to the Boston Consulting Group. In addition, note that the combined AUM of institutional-grade investment vehicles such as exchange-traded products is only about [2.5%](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.linkedin.com\u002Fpulse\u002F2021-outlook-bitcoin-crypto-industry-eli%25C3%25A9zer-ndinga\u002F?trackingId=reK1bBOtTyiNFf%2FN2awfdQ%3D%3D) of the whole crypto market, so it represents a small fraction.\n\n![No alt text provided for this image](https:\u002F\u002Flh4.googleusercontent.com\u002FP-1rKgWD1KpL5lPCdw4GBN9dQL5_mFJAlDLS_cJ1QoH78UrqNfJR6uzSZnrpTbl5rzMpm0DtCg_w881JDEXIQou1eucscp6TM_7HRgwYpo6lf8eOyB85dY4BMbhKwLBYOIOJS7-M)\n\n## Final Word\n\nLast but not least, Ark Invest [pointed out](https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002Fyassineark\u002Fstatus\u002F1357115574699057154?s=27) that if this bull market is as disruptive as the last bull market in 2017, then the price of Bitcoin could increase by 20x from its previous all-time high and reach as much as $390,000. You must be wondering why 20x? Well, Bitcoin experienced two cycles before this one ‚Äî in 2013 and 2017. In 2017, bitcoin traded at more than $1,000 and exceeded the highest level in 2013 by 20x to reach $19,000. Obviously, this is still a question mark and only time will tell. At 21Shares, we will closely monitor what the future holds.\n\n![No alt text provided for this image](https:\u002F\u002Flh6.googleusercontent.com\u002FRqprhMm1hgYIBUO2mJYY9gJ_alM3sXhGG7OMWgZNlAEF7G5pnlU4BH4A7TjoVYLabstV18ADMwdUIoKWgCqqy7tt-lKcxzfxgpwzTVavFcvhp-VOcW6hk5xnruv9-Ynv36QP9oGu)"},it:{title:"Valutare Bitcoin a Lungo Termine",content:"Il 3 marzo 2021, Swissquote, societ√† svizzera leader nel settore dei servizi finanziari e del trading, ha tenuto un webinar con pi√π di 300 partecipanti, insieme al team di 21Shares, su come si muover√† il valore del Bitcoin sia nel breve che nel lungo periodo\n\nNel concreto, questo panel √® stato organizzato per rispondere a due domande ben precise:\n\n1. Quali sono i parametri che dovremmo usare per tracciare le variazioni di prezzo di breve periodo e per valutare il sentiment degli investitori?\n2. Quali sono gli elementi che meglio indicano e forniscono una stima del valore di lungo periodo per coloro che operano su questo mercato?\n\nPer vedere l‚Äôintero episodio, clicca [qui](https:\u002F\u002F21shares.com\u002Fit\u002Fresearch\u002Fhow-to-value-bitcoin-short-term-long-term\u002F)\n\nQuesto articolo si concentrer√† soprattutto sulla seconda domanda: la valutazione del mercato delle criptovalute attraverso tre metodologie estremamente intuitive gi√† utilizzate per le valutazioni sul Bitcoin:\n\n* Il dimensionamento del mercato\n* Il rapporto sui profitti e le perdite non realizzati (NUPL ratio)\n* Il ciclo vitale della tecnologia alla base del Bitcoin\n\nInfine, spenderemo anche due parole sul potenziale di crescita del Bitcoin in questa fase del mercato\n\n### Tuttavia, prima di proseguire √® importante sottolineare che quella che seguir√† non √® una lista completa degli elementi che ci permettono di valutare l‚Äôandamento delle criptovalute.\n\nCi sono altri fattori importanti da prendere in considerazione, come la sicurezza del network e il livello di prevenzione degli attacchi informatici, insieme con il crescente utilizzo di fonti d‚Äôenergia rinnovabile per l‚Äôestrazione di Bitcoin, solo per fare alcuni esempi.\n\n## Dimensionamento Del Mercato\n\n√à stato dimostrato che il Bitcoin ha molte caratteristiche in comune con l‚Äôoro; per questo il Bitcoin viene spesso chiamato ‚Äúoro digitale‚Äù. Pertanto, facendo affidamento sul metodo del dimensionamento del mercato, si pu√≤ ottenere una stima del mercato disponibile totale (TAM) del Bitcoin, che in questo caso specifico equivale alla capitalizzazione del mercato dell‚Äôoro, valutata attorno ai 10 trilioni di dollari.\n\nIn teoria, se il mercato del Bitcoin raggiungesse il valore di quello dell‚Äôoro, il prezzo di una singola moneta digitale supererebbe i 500.000 dollari. Pi√π specificatamente, se si dividesse il valore totale per il numero di Bitcoin creati fino ad oggi (ovvero se dividessimo 10 trilioni per 18,6 milioni), otterremmo che il prezzo del Bitcoin equivarrebbe a circa 535.000 dollari.\n\n![](https:\u002F\u002Flh5.googleusercontent.com\u002FodSz7n0fARMmuVa9Hw1rdv04YyzrrK3tw-tcxwkGaZBjUuj0yFQMJb0v74wyxqj3F9NJBpwF4P2rfslsiKolO4e16DcBcsXSjxyMChNBVz4iUb931thc1ALPCX1FVmwdKm72x4v7)\n\nCome 21Shares, riteniamo che il Bitcoin abbia la possibilit√† addirittura di superare il mercato dell‚Äôoro. Infatti, il Bitcoin √® un asset nativo del mondo digitale, accessibile da chiunque sia dotato di una connessione a internet, in qualunque parte del mondo; inoltre ha un limite di offerta massimo pari a 21 milioni di unit√†. Ma una caratteristica ancora pi√π importante ‚Äì se inserita in un contesto di distanziamento sociale, di confini chiusi e di paura per la trasmissione del coronavirus ‚Äì √® che il Bitcoin, a differenza dell‚Äôoro, pu√≤ essere trasferito con la stessa facilit√† con cui si manda un‚Äôe-mail e miliardi di dollari potrebbero essere immagazzinati un una semplice chiavetta USB. In realt√†, √® sempre consigliato di attendere un‚Äôora o che almeno sei blocchi si aggiungano alla blockchain (occorrono 10 minuti per aggiungerne uno), per essere sicuri che la transizione sia andata in porto. Infine, la blockchain non pu√≤ essere manomessa, √® open-source e accessibile da chiunque.\n\nQuanto elencato fino a ora rende l‚Äôidea sul perch√© il Bitcoin sia meglio dell‚Äôoro. Inoltre, bisogna anche ricordare che questa analisi non prende in considerazione le innovazioni incredibili che si fondano sul Bitcoin, come Lightning Network e Stacks, che potrebbero espandere il TAM sia in termini di ordini che di dimensioni, e anche i casi di utilizzo documentati dalla Human Rights Foundation, che dimostrano come il Bitcoin possa agire da sistema monetario non controllabile a tutela dei diritti umani.\n\nA differenza del Bitcoin, l‚Äôoro √® un asset capace di resistere alla prova del tempo; inoltre, gode di una liquidit√† significativamente maggiore ed √® molto meno volatile rispetto alla criptovaluta, soprattutto perch√© quest‚Äôultima √® ancora una riserva di valore emergente, che dalla sua nascita ha visto aumentare il suo valore di 5 miliardi per cento. Infatti, il primo scambio che ha coinvolto il Bitcoin registrava un valore unitario di questo pari a 0,0009 dollari e fu effettuato da Marti Malmi, uno dei primi sviluppatori della criptovaluta, che pag√≤ 5,02 dollari per 5.050 BTC tramite PayPal per fondare una nuova piattaforma di scambio per asset digitali chiamata New Liberty Standard.\n\n![](https:\u002F\u002Flh3.googleusercontent.com\u002F6aJBXHagdrH-8kLPmCvm0dpdOpIE9tf44v9mUYMY7nVZQIJX2iNdF5uln1487IAGRB_l_MLCmeyPI7nZwi5Sc-3MsoroL5NxjfNK0a3zxg15jddr-aU-Tk7eaAG5i7YtVubhOe06)\n\n## Profitti E Perdite Netti Non Realizzati (NUPL)\n\nCome visto nel paragrafo precedente, il bello della blockchain √® il fatto di essere open-source: sebbene le transazioni siano anonime, gli orari e i valori di queste sono ben visibili a chiunque. Questo √® un elemento prezioso, che ci aiuta a comprendere meglio la psicologia di chi investe in criptovalute, basandoci sugli utili e le perdite che hanno conseguito. Cos√¨ come riportato anche in un libro di Morgan Housel intitolato The Psychology of Money: ‚ÄúInvestire non √® lo studio della finanza; √® lo studio di come le persone si comportano con il denaro.‚Äù\n\nIn parole povere, il NUPL misura i profitti e le perdite degli investitori ed √® stato una misura fondamentale per valutare il sentiment degli investitori e identificare i massimi e i minimi del prezzo del Bitcoin negli ultimi 10 anni. Innanzitutto, la capitalizzazione del mercato √® un parametro imperfetto per valutare come i singoli investitori valutino le criptovalute, poich√© non tiene conto del fatto che questi hanno orizzonti temporali differenti tra loro per venderle. Da qui nasce la ‚Äúrealized capitalization‚Äù ‚Äì ispirata da Pierre Rochard e creata alla fine del 2018 da Nic Carter e Antoine Le Calvez ‚Äì rappresentante il valore aggregato di ogni criptovaluta non ancora venduta.\n\nInfatti, non tutte le criptovalute hanno lo stesso costo di base. Per fare un esempio, 2 Bitcoin allocati in un portafoglio nel gennaio del 2017 avranno un costo base di circa 1.000 dollari l‚Äôuno, dato che il Bitcoin era scambiato a quel prezzo, e quindi un valore totale di 2.000 dollari. Di conseguenza, la formula del NUPL √® la seguente: capitalizzazione realizzata meno la capitalizzazione del mercato, il tutto diviso per la capitalizzazione del mercato. Questo rapporto equivale a 1 se il 100% degli investitori stanno conseguendo profitti, per poi scendere sotto lo 0 in caso di perdite.\n\nBisogna sempre ricordare che investire √® anche lo studio di come le persone si comportano con il denaro. A seconda che il mercato sia rialzista o ribassista, il valore del NUPL ratio categorizza lo stato d‚Äôanimo degli investitori in 5 categorie differenti, come si pu√≤ vedere dal grafico sottostante. Il rosso rappresenta la capitolazione, l‚Äôarancione √® speranza o paura, il giallo √® ottimismo o ansia, fiducia o negazione sono in verde ed euforia o avidit√† in blu. Facciamo un esempio concreto.\n\n![](https:\u002F\u002Flh3.googleusercontent.com\u002FLHLBcRfygCWvar-bRoB7td_-hiwf0rMwbwaqYfAU-iQVkJSS2AeTaqs5cbbcpNFKcpZuu-Q1HpZq95h9fa7OIbo9W3fuDkOj7FvDEnk5oHyZ-gsrDkI65cazPidRwsVSFUvmANPG)![](https:\u002F\u002Fdocs.google.com\u002Fdrawings\u002Fu\u002F1\u002Fd\u002Fs_6hKNt6HQ8T54kS1ZFAkOg\u002Fimage?w=76&h=20&rev=1&ac=1&parent=1veoUsZaQPzjsnhJdIOH86PdflIs6OguKoI2TcbSbRng)\n\nLo scorso anno, nel mese di marzo si √® verificato un crash di mercato dovuto alla pandemia del Covid-19 e il prezzo del Bitcoin √® precipitato dal suo massimo di allora di 7.000 dollari a 4.000 dollari. Una settimana dopo, il prezzo √® di nuovo schizzato a 6.000 dollari.\n\nSe si esamina la struttura blockchain, come si pu√≤ vedere nel grafico sottostante, quando il prezzo del Bitcoin crolla, l‚Äôasset passa dalle mani dei trader di breve periodo (cio√® che hanno acquistato quei Bitcoin meno di 6 mesi prima della vendita) in quelle di investitori di lungo periodo, che detengono Bitcoin per un periodo di tempo superiore a un anno. Questo spiega il rapido ritorno ai livelli precedenti il crash. Per usare la terminologia del NUPL ratio, quando i trader di breve periodo capitolano e liquidano le loro posizioni, gli investitori di lungo periodo trovano speranza nell‚Äôacquistare Bitcoin a un prezzo ridotto.\n\n![](https:\u002F\u002Flh4.googleusercontent.com\u002FUuXXPWVWX0mC7RctpzOWuVENrjtwWyOVW2dQqHwSKHtueUBRisBw7WjVOKHFKH02WuXHmzRn7BZoC01LhdHqhGpbs3R4ZPAUdMYIIs1HKAUCtWfYZkWmjEJAXz6LGLxwlxTSEabQ)\n\n## Il Ciclo Vitale Della Tecnologia\n\nL‚Äôultimo metodo di valutazione riguarda il ciclo vitale della tecnologia alla base delle criptovalute. Con questo vogliamo mostrare perch√© il processo di adozione delle criptovalute √® solo all‚Äôinizio.\n\nPrima di tutto, rispondiamo alla domanda ‚Äúquante persone possiedono delle criptovalute?‚Äù Secondo quanto riportato dall‚ÄôUniversit√† di Cambridge, gli utilizzatori di criptovalute sono oltre 100 milioni, ovvero il 2,5% di tutti coloro che nel mondo possiedono una connessione a internet, cio√® 4,6 miliardi di persone. La ragione per cui prendiamo come riferimento coloro cha hanno una connessione a internet come massima estensione del mercato, in questo caso, √® che questa √® necessaria per avere accesso a questi asset.\n\n![](https:\u002F\u002Flh3.googleusercontent.com\u002FefcpbUYY4twI970HCOFCQHZUHd4fxvRk3sNV-rY2YQzU4Hofv-7xq_2WYkj3Bl8OXs06x06u27NhdNv_6zGlxM95ryHDvbLe67cdVrE5wTPDSxsi0Nlw-fjPbhBKsKe2bGpbzHAg)\n\nPer chi non lo sapesse, il ciclo di vita dell‚Äôadozione di una nuova tecnologia √® un modello sociologico che descrive il processo di accettazione di un‚Äôinnovazione. Come mostrato a seguire, questo processo segue una curva simile a una campana e categorizza le diverse fasi dell‚Äôadozione di un bene o di un servizio a seconda delle peculiarit√† demografiche e psicologiche. Questo indica il primo gruppo di persone a introdurre la novit√† come ‚Äúinnovatori‚Äù, seguito poi dai ‚Äúprimi ad adottare‚Äù. Successivamente si ha una prima maggioranza, una seconda maggioranza e l‚Äôultimo gruppo dei ‚Äúritardatari‚Äù.\n\nApplicando il concetto precedente alle criptovalute, se solo il 2,5% di tutti coloro che hanno una connessione a internet possiede bitcoin, significa che la soglia dell‚Äôadozione su vasta scala non √® stata ancora raggiunta. Infatti, siamo ancora nella fase degli innovatori. Tuttavia, l‚Äôattrattivit√† del settore √® alta, soprattutto per coloro che provengono dalla finanza tradizionale, in cui un gruppo di leader di mercato all‚Äôavanguardia, come Paul Tudor Jones, Ruffer, Yale e Harvard si √® portata avanti sulla curva dell‚Äôadozione.\n\n![](https:\u002F\u002Flh6.googleusercontent.com\u002Fy1IbN_GS-dNracdegfdEL4ETbR4bdZkHBbKfulg7rNbqaBcFlGniGHFbVEpvVpfIGHmj-ppqUrWFZ_7D2LwiF36F2W7s6Hz2Ej1eXLbhE-bFgcTiwSEQsBOqqKgojqlKk_iOt9NJ)![](https:\u002F\u002Fdocs.google.com\u002Fdrawings\u002Fu\u002F1\u002Fd\u002FsvRDijFwaCSwFBiADD8M9nA\u002Fimage?w=97&h=22&rev=1&ac=1&parent=1veoUsZaQPzjsnhJdIOH86PdflIs6OguKoI2TcbSbRng)![](https:\u002F\u002Fdocs.google.com\u002Fdrawings\u002Fu\u002F1\u002Fd\u002FsGZCnA3vOEMOpXJNKpGcYrg\u002Fimage?w=179&h=21&rev=1&ac=1&parent=1veoUsZaQPzjsnhJdIOH86PdflIs6OguKoI2TcbSbRng)\n\nSono passati 12 anni dalla comparsa del Bitcoin e ci sono moltissime persone che pensano che ormai sia troppo tardi per trarne beneficio, ma come abbiamo, visto il ciclo vitale √® appena all‚Äôinizio. Per fare un paragone, possiamo guardare l‚Äôesempio di un‚Äôaltra innovazione tecnologica: nel 1997 Internet era utilizzato a malapena da 100 milioni di persone, esattamente l‚Äôequivalente nel 2021 del settore delle criptovalute.\n\n![](https:\u002F\u002Flh5.googleusercontent.com\u002F3UE2HSmfSQ0lwP_IBeZ5-VO6WQLEK1D-P68z2rELDOTxd36ztVALXZDyR42oqixZuDBqPX-E299WhA4m1Td1CQvkWfaok1BFNJQjVxTbdVn6C4krJQu1pFGOFFN2NeucTV-i1iGC)\n\nFonte diapositiva di destra: SkyBridge\n\nL‚Äôultimo punto sul ciclo dell‚Äôadozione riguarda la gestione delle risorse. Secondo uno studio che ha coinvolto 620 tra banchieri e consulenti finanziari che gestiscono complessivamente 3 trilioni di dollari in patrimoni, tra coloro che hanno un patrimonio particolarmente elevato, solo l‚Äô1% di questo √® stato investito in asset digitali. Non √® ai livelli dell‚Äôoro, che si attesta al 3%, ma riteniamo che le criptovalute lo possano superare nel lungo periodo. Teniamo sempre presente che la gestione patrimoniale √® un mercato enorme, stimato sugli 89 trilioni di dollari di asset under management (AUM), secondo il Boston Consulting Group. Inoltre, bisogna sottolineare che gli AUM in strumenti investment-grade, come i prodotti scambiati in borsa, sono solo il 2,5% dell‚Äôintero mercato delle criptovalute, ovvero una piccola percentuale.\n\n![](https:\u002F\u002Flh3.googleusercontent.com\u002FD7KqLZWX3thZnvUmFPqJoUstM7gYU9wn-UFFto1xVAWZsFlUFdUBBdFGSkOwh3hsL78UK1Bf6tlGHqwHCVmsvNl5t1pyR1yReDsnMzn_sgMITUfhZSI5e-oDfqJgUhyA-iAQQ7vL)\n\n## Conclusioni\n\nInfine, Ark Invest ha affermato che se il mercato delle criptovalute √® disruptive come lo √® stato l‚Äôultimo momento di mercato rialzista nel 2017, allora il prezzo del Bitcoin potrebbe crescere anche di 20 volte rispetto al valore massimo raggiunto fino a oggi, arrivando a toccare quota 390.000 dollari. Qualcuno potrebbe chiedersi perch√© dovrebbe registrare un incremento cos√¨ elevato; ebbene, prima di questo, il Bitcoin ha attraversato 2 cicli ‚Äì uno nel 2013 e uno nel 2017. Nel 2013, la criptovaluta era scambiata a pi√π di 1.000 dollari ed √® arrivata a valerne 19.000 nel 2017. Quasi venti volte maggiore. Ovviamente, al momento questo rimane ancora un punto interrogativo a cui solo il tempo sapr√† rispondere, ma noi di 21Shares continueremo a monitorare attentamente cosa ci riserva il futuro.\n\n![](https:\u002F\u002Flh4.googleusercontent.com\u002F9IdjQD0ttNGcj7iUWWb7RXhZSm0xwSPVCcu-5_JEt7TYddSpI08QAAb5A47aG8-IqSjQgTzAUXzOGMKJa1Mst8VwpBgdKmXWMPjDevnfkS0dQkBICcu98HDpB6DcYFPUAf9XlvVA)"},slug:"valuing-bitcoin-in-the-long-term",mediaUrl:a,featured:ar,date:"2021-03-05T10:09:31.700Z",tags:[C],image:"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.21shares.com\u002Fuploads\u002Fcurrent-documents\u002Fhow-to-value-btc.jpg",category:ah},{de:{title:bf,content:hC,file:hB},en:{title:bf,content:hC,file:hB},it:{title:bf,content:"**Questo rapporto di ricerca identificher√† e analizzer√† le diverse metodologie per la valutazione del Bitcoin.

One of the main arguments of opponents of Bitcoin's use of proof-of-work mining is the excessive amount of electricity needed to secure the Bitcoin system. However, there are arguments to suggest that Bitcoin could also give society significant benefits by helping  \"bank the unbanked\" and give billions of people access to financial markets, which the traditional money system cannot. So does this added benefit outweigh the additional costs? Tune in to hear our views.

The primary contributor to the cool-down of the wider token sale market has been a general fear of action by the SEC and the intricacies of each of the SEC's token sale-related cases thus far will have long-term impacts on the crypto asset market.

Ethereum Trust (ETHE) investors have bought shares at a market price 262% above NAV on average\n* This is driven by the lack of a redemption mechanism for Grayscale‚Äôs products as well as the sporadic creation of Grayscale shares, in contract with the options available to European investors such as the 21Shares Bitcoin ETP (ABTC) and 21Shares Ethereum ETP (AETH)\n* It is likely that a great deal of the institutional investors who create GBTC and ETHE  shares are doing to profit solely from the premium, rather than to take a position on Bitcoin or Ethereum\n* Bitcoin and Ethereum products available in Europe such as ABTC and AETH have had much smaller premiums of 0.58% and 0.87% equally available to both retail and institutional investors\n\nFill out the form to download the

[announced](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.coindesk.com\u002Ffinland-pushes-to-sell-tainted-trove-of-bitcoins-worth-tens-of-millions) on Thursday, January 7th, their right to sell over $69 million worth of Bitcoin which was seized from drug traders. Although there is no publicly-available evidence to this sale, we suspect it became part of the bearish sentiment over the weekend for short-term traders. Yesterday, the crypto market experienced a [correction](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.bloomberg.com\u002Fnews\u002Farticles\u002F2021-01-11\u002Fbitcoin-drops-most-over-two-days-since-may-as-volatility-resumes?sref=vuYGislZ) of as much as 26%, starting on Sunday, January 10th as a derivative-driven flash crash caused by weekend traders on unregulated crypto exchanges becoming too levered on the way up to $40K which then lead to a subsequent cascade of liquidations of over $2 billion.\n\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.mcauto-images-production.sendgrid.net\u002F3b7436794fe7d912\u002Ff9fd8083-72d5-4775-8fb8-214ef9153523\u002F1600x897.png)\n\nThis has been exacerbated by issues with some other crypto exchanges like Coinbase which experienced service outages preventing some users' bids from going through ‚Äî making the selling pressure even more noticeable due to price discrepancies against other exchanges. On top of that, the issue with Coinbase played an important role in [fueling](https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002Fwoonomic\u002Fstatus\u002F1348703519201628162?s=20) the market downtrend in the futures markets as many derivatives exchanges rely on Coinbase‚Äôs price feed for their index calculations. To add to the bearish sentiment over the last two days, the fact that the CIO of Guggenheim [argued](https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002FScottMinerd\u002Fstatus\u002F1348493010338803713?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1348493010338803713%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bloomberg.com%2Fnews%2Farticles%2F2021-01-11%2Fbitcoin-drops-most-over-two-days-since-may-as-volatility-resumes) on Twitter that the price surge of Bitcoin was not sustainable in the near term further created to some extent panic selling for market participants that bought recently in the past weeks.\\\n\\\nFor less than an hour, Bitcoin traded as low as $30.6K but has since retrieved its losses and at the time of writing this research note, Bitcoin is valued at around $34K. In retrospect, Bitcoin broke the $30K mark for the first time in history on January 2nd this year and has returned nearly 400% since the start of 2020.\n\nFor the record, although past performances are not always an accurate indication of future results, on January 5th 2017 Bitcoin dumped 20% after recently making a new all-time-highs of over $1K after a 3-year bear market Bitcoin, it then appreciated 2,500% by the end of that year. Yesterday, January 11th 2021, Bitcoin dropped by more than 20% after recently breaking a new all-time high of $30K after a 3-year bear market. While the previous bull run of 2017 was mostly retail-driven, this time it is clearly organic demand and institutional driven and most importantly based on macroeconomic circumstances.","21Shares Research Newsletter - Issue 91","21Shares Research Newsletter ‚Äî Issue 92","21Shares Research Newsletter - Issue 93","21Shares Research Newsletter - Issue 94","21Shares Research Newsletter ‚Äì Issue 95","2019-11-15","2019-11-14","2019-12-28T00:00:00.000Z","2019-11-13","2019-11-12","2019-11-11","2019-11-08","2019-11-07","2019-11-06","2019-11-05","state-of-crypto","2019-11-04","2019-10-31","2019-10-30","2019-10-29","2019-10-28","2019-10-25","2019-10-24","2019-10-23","2019-10-22","2019-10-21","2019-10-18","2019-10-17","2019-10-16","21Shares Crypto Market Outlook April 16, 2020 | Hansen Wang and Lanre Ige","2020-04-17T12:59:00.000Z","21Shares Crypto Market Outlook April 23, 2020 | Hansen Wang and Davide Vicini","21Shares Crypto Market Outlook April 30, 2020 | Hansen Wang and Davide Vicini","2020-04-30T12:59:00.000Z","21Shares Crypto Market Outlook April 9, 2020 | Hansen Wang and Davide Vicini","Our senior associates Davide Vicini and Hansen Wang gave their weekly update on the market.
